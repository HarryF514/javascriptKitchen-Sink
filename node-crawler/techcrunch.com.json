Nexar is a startup hoping to make collective collision avoidance a more achievable reality in the short-term, using their Ai-based dash cam app.</p><p>Nexar’s app is available for iOS and Android, and uses your phone’s camera to monitor the road ahead as you drive, recording events when it detects danger using its artificial intelligence engine. The video of the event is then automatically uploaded to the cloud for later reference, and the phone also logs sensor data to help recreate a simulation of what happened to your vehicle at the moment of the incident.</p><p>Starting today, the app will also start providing crowdsourced data to help predict and prevent collisions, by sharing that info among users of its app, starting in San Francisco and New York first. The idea it to provide real-time warnings about potential collisions using just the smartphone itself, building a road map that can be shared across its pool of users.</p><p>Using data collected by individual instances of the app about accidents, Nexar’s network will use real-time interpretation of the data to try to anticipate the best way to minimize the impact of these accidents and alert other drivers on the network before they also become involved. If you think about multi-car pileups, often the issue is that cars involved later in the process just don’t have the information they need quickly enough to avoid being caught up.</p><p>Waze provides similar crowdsourced warnings about upcoming traffic obstructions and collisions to watch out for, but Nexar’s use of video analysis and machine learning applied to computer vision could help it be more responsive in real-time to incidents that pose an immediate threat.</p>",

    "content": "<p>WhatsApp wants to be international cross-platform FaceTime. Today Facebook-owned chat service WhatsApp is officially launching video calling for its over 1 billion users worldwide on iOS, Android and Windows Phone. Its debut follows a series of reports from people who recently found the feature had been enabled in beta versions of WhatsApp on Android and on Windows Phone – an indication that a public debut was on the near horizon.</p><p>To use the new feature, WhatsApp users can hit the call button in the top right corner of a conversation, which will bring up an overlaid interstitial asking if you want to voice or video call the friend or family member you’re chatting with. To kick off the video call, you simply select the “video call” option from this screen.</p><p>During the call itself, you can switch between the forward-facing and rear camera, mute the call or press the red button to hang up. It seems the user interface varies slightly on Android and iPhone in terms of where the picture-in-picture video feed is displayed, as well as the buttons’ size, lineup and placement. (See images and video below).</p><p>WhatsApp already supports a number of standard features for communications apps, including group texting and voice calling. But the company says that video calling has remained one of its top feature requests from users.</p><p>With video calling, WhatsApp is belatedly catching up with a number of rivals, including Facebook’s own Messenger app, for example, as well as Skype, Apple’s FaceTime, Viber, LINE and Google’s recently launched Duo, to name a few.</p><p>Though a late entrant, WhatsApp still has a massive user base and the addition of the feature could help them from fleeing to other messaging and calling platforms. In addition, WhatsApp touts its cross-platform support as one of the reasons to use video calling in its app, instead of elsewhere.</p><p>“…we want to make these features available to everyone, not just those who can afford the most expensive new phones or live in countries with the best cellular networks,” the company said in its announcement, published today.</p><p>That’s a direct shot at things like FaceTime, which only works on Apple devices, as well as newer arrivals, like Google Duo, which only runs on later versions of iOS and Android (Jelly Bean and up, or iOS 9 and up).</p><p>You may not immediately see video calling in WhatsApp today, however. The rollout is staged, meaning it will arrive over the days ahead as it reaches the entire WhatsApp user base.</p><p>Video calling isn’t the only new addition to arrive recently. The company also rolled out two-factor authentication in some of its beta versions, hinting that its next big release could be a security-focused upgrade.</p><p>By retaining its simple interface but embracing more vivid connections beyond texting, WhatsApp could flourish with users no matter how they want to communicate</p>",

    "content": "<p>A controversial decision this summer by Facebook-owned messaging giant WhatsApp to share data on its users with its parent company — including for advertising purposes — continues to attract the ire of European regulators.</p><p>Now Facebook has agree to pause data sharing in the UK, following an investigation by data protection watchdog, the ICO. Although TechCrunch understands this pause only applies to sharing user information for products/ads purposes; WhatsApp user data is still being shared with Facebook for fighting spam and other business intelligence purposes (such as deduplicating the number of users across different Facebook-owned services).</p><p>Update: We also understand the data-sharing pause applies across all 28 European Union Member States at this point.</p><p>In a strongly worded blog post detailing how its probe has been progressing, UK information commissioner Elizabeth Denham writes: “I had concerns that consumers weren’t being properly protected, and it’s fair to say the enquiries my team have made haven’t changed that view. I don’t think users have been given enough information about what Facebook plans to do with their information, and I don’t think WhatsApp has got valid consent from users to share the information. I also believe users should be given ongoing control over how their information is used, not just a 30 day window.”</p><p>“We’ve set out the law clearly to Facebook, and we’re pleased that they’ve agreed to pause using data from UK WhatsApp users for advertisements or product improvement purposes,” she adds.</p><p>Denham also hits out at “vague terms of service” for generally failing to give consumers “the protection we need”.</p><p>The updated WhatsApp privacy policy offered users an opt out of sharing their data with Facebook but default opted them in — unless they clicked to read the terms more closely and turned the sharing option off, having understood what the toggle represented. Users were also given a 30-day window to revoke consent via the settings in the app — after which they would be unable to withdraw consent. None of which has pleased the ICO.</p><p>In the blog post Denham says the ICO has asked Facebook and WhatsApp to sign an undertaking committing to “better explaining to customers how their data will be used, and to giving users ongoing control over that information”, and goes on to warn the company may face enforcement action if it does not alter its approach.</p><p>“We also want individuals to have the opportunity to be given an unambiguous choice before Facebook start using that information and to be given the opportunity to change that decision at any point in the future. We think consumers deserve a greater level of information and protection, but so far Facebook and WhatsApp haven’t agreed. If Facebook starts using the data without valid consent, it may face enforcement action from my office,” she continues.</p><p>In a statement on the ICO’s action, a Facebook spokesperson rejected criticism it is not being clear enough with WhatsApp users about the data-sharing arrangement, telling TechCrunch: “WhatsApp designed its privacy policy and terms update to give users a clear and simple explanation of how the service works, as well as choice over how their data is used. These updates comply with applicable law, and follow the latest guidance from the UK Information Commissioner’s Office.”</p><p>Facebook’s spokesperson added: “We hope to continue our detailed conversations with the ICO and other data protection officials, and we remain open to working collaboratively to address their questions.”</p><p>TechCrunch understands the company has had multiple meetings with the ICO about the matter, as well as also receiving questions from several other European regulators who also have concerns about the arrangement. WhatsApp-Facebook data-sharing is on pause in all 28 European Union Member States at this point.</p><p>In September Facebook and WhatsApp were ordered by a local data protection regulator in Germany to stop sharing data on users. Facebook said at the time it would be appealing that order.</p><p>The Spanish DPA has also stated publicly that it intends to investigate the data-sharing arrangement.</p><p>The data transfer arrangement is now being probed by the European Union’s data protection watchdog group, which is made up of representatives from all EU Member State DPAs. The Article 29 Working Party said in October its members (such as the ICO) would be acting “in a coordinated way” to target any problems they identify, and to co-ordinate any enforcement action they may deem necessary.</p><p>Denham said the ICO intends to keep “pushing”, along with its fellow European DPAs, for WhatsApp users to be provided with more information about how data shared with Facebook will be used; as well as for a clearer description of the choice they have to share or not to share; and for users to have an ongoing choice to revoke consent.</p><p>In her blog post she also flags a wider data protection concern related to companies triangulating user data via acquisition — a concern that has also been voiced by the EU’s competition commissioner this year. And raised most recently as an objection to the Microsoft-LinkedIn acquisition.</p><p>“It’s a particular concern when company mergers mean that vast amounts of customers’ personal data become an asset to be bought and sold,” writes Denham. “We’re seeing situations where companies are being  bought primarily for this data, and when it is combined with information the purchasing company already holds, there’s a danger that consumers will have little control as datasets are matched and intrusive details revealed.”</p><p>She says the regulator is planning to publish a report on this early next year.</p><p>“It’s a problem that is broader than data protection, and we’re speaking with industry, competition regulators and consumer groups to see how we can make people clearer on the law. We’ll be publishing a report on this in the new year, outlining our concerns and discussing solutions.”</p><p>This post w</p>",

    "content": "<p>Amid increased competition from Apple’s iMessage, Snapchat, and Google’s new entry Allo, Facebook-owned WhatsApp has now rolled out support for sharing GIFs in its messaging application on iOS. According to the app update text in iTunes, the new feature will allow users to send and receive GIFs, including Live Photos and shorter videos, both of which can be now converted to animated GIFs.</p><p>For videos, the clip has to be six seconds or shorter, in order to be sent as a GIF. Meanwhile, you can send a Live Photo as a GIF by using the 3D Touch feature from the “Attach” interface. From there, you’ll choose the option “Select as GIF” when selecting the Live Photo from your Photo and Video Library.</p><p>While you can send GIFs (and Live Photos or videos) from your phone, WhatsApp also includes an integrated GIF search engine, powered by Tenor or Giphy. (We’ve asked the company to clarify how it’s choosing which engine to display as the default to which users, but it didn’t yet respond.)</p><p>You can search through the available GIFs to find those you want to share, and mark select items as Favorites to be used again in the future.</p><p>In addition, you can edit your GIFs after selecting them, by trimming the clip, rotating it, by adding emoji or colorful text, ahead of hitting “Send.”</p><p>All of these changes have not yet rolled out to the Android version of the app, which could be why WhatsApp hasn’t yet made an official announcement about the update. The features were also available during beta tests. During the testing period, WhatsApp switched the default GIF search engine from Giphy to Tenor at one point.</p><p>However, Giphy is still involved. “We’ve been working with WhatsApp since they started exploring integrating GIFs,” notes Giphy’s Director of Biz Dev, David Rosenberg, adding that it’s fairly standard for apps like this to leverage multiple providers.</p><p>WhatsApp also confirmed to us that both Giphy and Tenor are being used, but the selection is not based on region. There are no other GIF providers involved, however. The company wouldn’t comment on when the same feature set is arriving on Android.</p><p>The change comes at a time when Facebook has been increasingly focused on competing more directly with rival Snapchat through a number of features across its platforms, including Facebook itself, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. More recently, the company was spotted testing a clone of Snapchat’s Stories feature on WhatsApp, called “Status.” This offered a similar editing interface, as it allowed users to snap photos or videos then using an in-app editor to add other content, including their own scribbles, text and emoji.</p>",

    "content": "<p>While it would have been nice to tackle this issue before the election, Google and Facebook are finally taking a tiny step in order to fight back against fake news. According to multiple statements, both companies have updated their policies to ban fake news sites from using Facebook’s and Google’s advertising networks.</p><p>With the U. S. election, fake news became incredibly popular on social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, as well as news aggregating services, such as Google News and news articles in Google search results. We’re not talking about opinion articles — we’re talking about reports spreading blatantly inaccurate information.</p><p>Google first updated its policy saying that the company will try to ban sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” Websites who don’t comply with this rule will get banned from using Google AdSense.</p><p>When it comes to Facebook, the company has also updated its policy to rule out fake news sites from using Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>Google AdSense and Facebook Audience Network let content publishers display ads on their websites. Google and Facebook manage the ad inventories, content publishers get a cut for clicks or impressions.</p><p>Both companies already have strict policies for their ad networks. For instance, you can’t use Google AdSense on a porn website. Google uses a combination of algorithms and human moderation to decide whether a site is eligible to use its advertising service.</p><p>By removing a potential revenue stream, it makes the business of fake news a bit less lucrative. For instance, Buzzfeed discovered that more than 100 fake news sites were created in a tiny city in Macedonia. So it’s clear that it’s not just about influencing the election — people are taking advantage of social networks to make money using fake news.</p><p>But there will always be alternative revenue streams, so this move is not enough. Reducing the reach of these websites is the best way to prevent fake news sites from popping out. If Facebook, Twitter, Google News and other websites flagged fake news appropriately, then there would be no reason to create fake news sites in the first place.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Facebook built two versions of a fix for clickbait this year, and decided to trust algorithmic machine learning detection instead of only user behavior, a Facebook spokesperson tells TechCrunch.</p><p>Today Facebook was hit with more allegations its distribution of fake news helped elect Donald Trump. A new Gizmodo report saying Facebook shelved a planned update earlier this year that could have identified fake news because it would disproportionately demote right-wing news outlets.</p><p>Facebook directly denies this, telling TechCrunch “The article’s allegation is not true. We did not build and withhold any News Feed changes based on their potential impact on any one political party.”</p><p>However, TechCrunch has pulled more details from Facebook about the update Gizmodo discusses.</p><p>Back in January 2015, Facebook rolled out an update designed to combat hoax news stories, which demoted links that were heavily flagged as fake by users, and that were often deleted later by users who posted them. That system is still in place.</p><p>In August 2016, Facebook released another News Feed update designed to reduce clickbait stories. Facebook trained a machine learning algorithm by having humans identify common phrases in old news headlines of clickbait stories. The machine learning system then would identify and demote future stories that featured those clickbait phrases.</p><p>According to Facebook, it developed two different options for how the 2016 clickbait update would work. One was a classifier based off the 2015 hoax detector based on user reports, and another was the machine learning classifier built specifically for detecting clickbait via computer algorithm.</p><p>Facebook says it found the specially-made machine learning clickbait detector performed better with fewer false positives and false negatives, so that’s what Facebook released. It’s possible that that the unreleased version is what Gizmodo is referring to as the shelved update. Facebook tells me that unbalanced clickbait demotion of right-wing stories wasn’t why it wasn’t released, but political leaning could still be a concern.</p><p>The choice to rely on a machine learning algorithm rather than centering the fix around user reports aligns with Facebook’s recent push to reduce the potential for human bias in its curation, which itself has been problematic.</p><p>A Gizmodo report earlier this year alleged that Facebook’s human Trend curators used their editorial freedom to suppress conservative trends. Facebook denied the allegations but fired its curation team, moving to a more algorithmic system without human-written Trend descriptions. Facebook was then criticized for fake stories becoming trends, and the New York Times reports “The Trending Topics episode paralyzed Facebook’s willingness to make any serious changes to its products that might compromise the perception of its objectivity.”</p><p>If Facebook had rolled out the unreleased version of its clickbait fix, it might have relied on the subjective opinions of staffers reviewing user reports about hard-to-classify clickbait stories the way it does with more cut-and-dry hoaxes. Meanwhile, political activists or trolls could have abused the reporting feature, mass-flagging accurate stories as false if they conflicted with their views.</p><p>This tricky situation is the inevitable result of engagement-ranked social feeds becoming massively popular distribution channels for news in a politically-polarized climate where campaign objectives and ad revenue incentivize misinformation.</p><p>Facebook as well as other news distributors such as Twitter and Google have a challenge ahead. Clear hoaxes that can be disproven with facts are only part of the problem, and perhaps are easier to address. Exaggerated and heavily-spun stories that might be considered clickbait may prove tougher to fight.</p><p>Because Facebook and some other platforms reward engagement, news outlets are incentivized to frame stories as sensationally as possible. While long-running partisan outlets may be held accountable for exaggeration, newer outlets built specifically to take advantage of virality on networks like Facebook don’t face the same repercussions. They can focus on short-term traffic and ad revenue, and if people get fed up with their content, they can simply reboot with a different brand.</p><p>Simplifying user flagging of fake or exaggerated stories, appending fact-checking sites to suspicious articles, and withholding distribution from domains that haven’t proven their accuracy but prioritize monetization could be some ways to fight the avalanche of fake news. More clearly needs to be done.</p><p>But perhaps its risky to demand networks like Facebook become the truth police. That could force it to make more wide-reaching calls about what to censor that would inevitably invite blame. At least technology platforms that err on the side of ranking by engagement allow users to decide individually if what they read is false or exaggerated. Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reiterated this perspective, writing “I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.”</p><p>Right now, Facebook is damned if does allow fake news to spread because it relies on users to think for themselves, but it’s damned if it doesn’t allow fake news to spread because it makes decisions about what to censor that remove the power of choice from its users. The social network will have to choose its next moves carefully.</p>",

    "content": "<p>WhatsApp will finally take a step to becoming a platform after the Facebook-owned company revealed it will begin to integrate businesses services into its app before the end of this year.</p><p>The company first announced plans to connect its userbase — which stands at more than one billion — with businesses back in January, and it today it updated its terms of service in preparation for testing with selected users “in the months ahead.”</p><p>What kind of dialogue will WhatsApp facilitate between users and businesses?</p><p>The aim is to keep things useful, such as flight notifications, receipts or delivery tracking, although marketing messages are mentioned in the newest version of the company’s T&Cs:</p><p>We will explore ways for you and businesses to communicate with each other using WhatsApp, such as through order, transaction, and appointment information, delivery and shipping notifications, product and service updates, and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you may receive containing marketing could include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications, and we will honor the choices you make.</p><p>The move is a very notable one given that WhatsApp has always taken a very aggressive ‘no spam’ approach to its business. “Marketing” messages and “an offer for something that might interest you” could fall into the category of spam if not done right, context is key here.</p><p>Back in 2012, CEO and co-founder Jan Koum threw shade on a number of rival messaging companies which he claimed were “selling” ads to their users:</p><p>No one wakes up excited to see more advertising, no one goes to sleep thinking about the ads they’ll see tomorrow. We know people go to sleep excited about who they chatted with that day (and disappointed about who they didn’t). We want WhatsApp to be the product that keeps you awake… and that you reach for in the morning. No one jumps up from a nap and runs to see an advertisement.</p><p>Advertising isn’t just the disruption of aesthetics, the insults to your intelligence and the interruption of your train of thought. At every company that sells ads, a significant portion of their engineering team spends their day tuning data mining, writing better code to collect all your personal data, upgrading the servers that hold all the data and making sure it’s all being logged and collated and sliced and packaged and shipped out… And at the end of the day the result of it all is a slightly different advertising banner in your browser or on your mobile screen.</p><p>The irony here is that many of those in Koum’s firing line — WeChat, Line, and Kakao — weren’t pushing ads. They opted to make money by connecting businesses with users via “official accounts” that companies could pay to rent and promote. As we wrote before, the ability to reach users directly is a potentially a very powerful new tool — and it remains opt-in for uses. Actual banner ads are few and far between in the messaging space because they ruin the user experience and look alien inside chat, which is a highly personal and curated space.</p><p>It isn’t exactly clear whether WhatsApp’s ‘business communication’ push will be like official accounts, the company didn’t go into detail on the format. What it did say, however, is that it will begin sharing data, and in particular, users’ phone numbers, with Facebook — the company that acquired WhatsApp for a fee that ultimately rose to $22 million — which is a key way it hopes to make messages relevant and not spammy.</p><p>That’s quite a big admission, although WhatsApp users will be able to opt out of sharing their information with Facebook.</p><p>For those who go with the default, this is how your data will be put to work:</p><p>As part of the Facebook family of companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, this family of companies. We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings. This includes helping improve infrastructure and delivery systems, understanding how our Services or theirs are used, securing systems, and fighting spam, abuse, or infringement activities. Facebook and the other companies in the Facebook family also may use information from us to improve your experiences within their services such as making product suggestions (for example, of friends or connections, or of interesting content) and showing relevant offers and ads. However, your WhatsApp messages will not be shared onto Facebook for others to see. In fact, Facebook will not use your WhatsApp messages for any purpose other than to assist us in operating and providing our Services.</p><p>These are major concessions for WhatsApp, but they are fairly inevitable. Facebook spent a lot of money acquiring the company, and while I believe that it wants to build rival chat app Messenger into the more feature-rich ‘WeChat-style’ chat/mobile portal service, it has a duty to monetize WhatsApp. Indeed, Mark Zuckerberg himself once said that monetization begins when a service reaches one billion users, so here we are.</p><p>There is a tendency to view this plan as negative, particularly given that other WhatsApp updates have added useful features to the service — such as encrypted communication and voice calls. On the positive side, the WhatsApp service will retain its focus on simplicity and usability, so don’t expect there to be many distractions from the existing messaging interface you see now.</p><p>But, of course, we don’t know for sure just yet.</p><p>WhatsApp has been fairly vague with its plans for now, so we’ll have to wait until it begins field testing business communications to learn more. Other apps have pioneered the </p>",

At first glance, that may seem like an odd acquisition for a company like GE. It’s important to keep in mind, though, that with Predix, GE already offers its customers a service that focuses on helping them monitor their equipment, whether that’s an industrial tool or an aircraft engine, and predict issues based on the monitoring data.</p><p>As GE CIO Jim Fowler told me, the company’s developers wrote a few hundred different models for lots of different assets in Predix. The service has some rudimentary AI capabilities, but the addition of Wise.io’s technology — which can find patterns on its own — and its team will allow GE to offer a far more flexible model. “As we think about services going forward, you’ll see GE enter verticals we haven’t been in before,” Fowler told me.</p><p>In many ways, GE itself is undergoing the kind of digital transformation that many of its own customers are dealing with. It’s undergoing what Fowler called a “new industrial revolution,” where it has to reposition itself to play in the field of analytics, data, machine learning, etc. To keep pace, the company has been making a number of acquisitions. These include the purchase of ServiceMax for almost $1 billion yesterday and Wise.io today (as well as the rather quiet acquisition of data integration platform Bit Stew earlier this year).</p><p>GE and Wise.io did not disclose the acquisition price. Wise.io previously raised $3.58 million. The company also participated in the Alchemist Accelerator and Citrix Startup Accelerator programs.</p><p>Wise.io will continue to operate as usual and GE will continue to service its existing customers. While the company is mostly buying Wise.io for its technology and talent, this also means it’s getting access to quite a few Wise.io customers who probably never considered GE as a vendor. Wise.io’s users currently include the likes of Pinterest, Twilio, Thumbtack and Republic Wireless.</p><p>GE expects that software will bring in $15 billion in revenue by 2020 (I wonder if it used Predix to set that number…). The vast majority of this ($10 billion) will likely come from existing customers, $1 billion will come from the efficiencies it hopes to gain by driving internal usage of technologies like Wise.io and it expects that $4 billion will come from new customers.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Today at the DLD conference in Munich, Germany, the CEO of Facebook-owned WhatsApp made a couple of big announcements about how the messaging app plans to evolve to its next phase as it approaches 1 billion users: the company plans to drop its $0.99 annual subscription fee, and it will start to test out more commercial services — specifically a B2C business for companies to communicate with their customers.</p><p>The B2C business is in a testing phase now, WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum said, with the focus on large corporate customers like Bank of America.</p><p>The subscription fee — which used to kick in after a year of free use — may be getting scrapped in favor of alternative revenues. But this won’t include ads, Koum said.</p><p>“We’re going to get rid of the $1 subscription,” Koum said, later admitting that the backup business model — courting corporates to build B2C services — is still pretty nascent. “We haven’t written a single line of code, [but we want to] make sure people understand this is not about ads in the product,” he said.</p><p>If you recall, when Facebook announced it would acquire WhatsApp for $19 billion almost two years ago, both companies were unequivocal about not putting ads into WhatsApp and sharing user data with commercial entities.</p><p>WhatsApp last updated its user numbers — who connect to the service by way of their mobile phone numbers, a hot link in a space where app developers oftentimes don’t “know” their users that well — at 900 million this past September. This profile in Wired notes that today the actual number is around 990 million.</p><p>That is a tempting amount of scale for a digital advertising business, making the commitment to no ads all the more interesting to watch, to see how and if it ever bends or gets dropped altogether.</p><p>In any case, since we have not had much transparency on what subscription fees brought to WhatsApp’s bottom line,  it is not clear how big of a revenue gulf will result for WhatsApp from scrapping subscription fees. Anecdotally, I have been using the app for a while and cannot recall ever paying to do so. Several others have noted the same to me.</p><p>The reason for scrapping the fee may be more than simply moving to a different revenue model, too.</p><p>The messaging app field is very, very crowded, with many lookalike apps offering essentially the same functionality — to WhatsApp add Facebook’s own Messenger, WeChat, Line, Viber and more — and many others that are offering their own takes on the basic premise — for example Snapchat with its image-based ephemeral notes, or Wickr and Telegram with their ephemeral, encrypted services.</p><p>On the B2C front, there is also the spectre of competitors from other directions. Slack, for example, has focused mainly on messaging for teams within companies as well as looser, like-minded communities. Today, users can already integrate other CRM apps to use Slack to manage customer interactions, but it seems like an obvious move for the startup to build out a native product like this to manage those interactions itself.</p><p>Turning back to WhatsApp, we have no information yet about how much WhatsApp would charge businesses to be a part of this new B2C effort.</p><p>The commercial service, Koum said, will start in the form of a test. “Starting this year, we will test tools that allow you to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations that you want to hear from,” Koum said. He named Bank of America and American Airlines as two possible kinds of companies that would be working with WhatsApp. It sounds like there are around 10-30 businesses already talking to WhatsApp for the service.</p><p>“We want to build things that are utilitarian,” he said. “That allows a company like American Airlines or Bank of America to communicate efficiently through a messaging app like WhatsApp.”</p><p>The conversation on stage also ranged into how Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp were different from each other. Indeed, Messenger, which has 800 million users, is also working on how to build services with businesses.</p><p>“I think there is some aspect of a geographic split,” Koum said, with WhatsApp particularly strong in developing markets and Europe. “It’s [also] about user experience,” he added. He was not asked about, nor did he address, the fact that Messenger is also building business tools, as well as its own intranet messaging service via Facebook at Work.</p><p>“Facebook is a little different in terms of UX, stickers and things we don’t have,” Koum continued. “What we find, interestingly enough, is that you may think messaging is limited but it’s not. People find more bandwidth to use different things that are out there.”</p><p>Facebook — via WhatsApp and its own Messenger product — is not the only one trying to figure out ways of leveraging free messaging services to build commercial operations in other ways.</p><p>Twitter has been working with a number of companies working on ways to build CRM tools for companies who may start public interactions with users to take those conversations into the DM channel and link up customer and Twitter accounts to serve them more efficiently.</p><p>In many cases, the tools that companies like Facebook and Twitter are trying to build are natural and obvious extensions of how these platforms are being used already as less formal ways of keeping people connected to their customers.</p><p>Building products around those existing actions also ties the consumers more closely to the platform that is being used to do that communicating (in this case WhatsApp at the expense of one of those many other messaging alternatives), and possibly making a little revenue out of it in the process.</p><p>In terms of other new WhatsApp products, the company is also working on adding more encryption.</p><p>“We’ve been doing it without people even realising it’s happening,” he said, somewhat alarmingly. He says “we are still there a couple months away” from all your messages being end-to-end encrypted but that is the goal. It will be, Koum said. “the largest installation </p>",

    "content": "<p>Pokémon games always have big shoes to fill, given the long history of the series and the affection its players hold for its world and its games. Pokémon Sun and Moon, the latest installments, also may well be the first Pokémon console experience for many players, riding the hype wave of mobile hit Pokémon Go as it does.</p><p>Luckily, the game delivers a lot for players both old and new, with plenty of familiar fun, but a fresh feeling world and replacement for the Gym system that brings new life to the franchise.</p><p>This latest 3DS Pokémon game brings the franchise to a set of islands that is pretty clearly based on Hawaii, called the ‘Alola Region’ in game. The tropical Alola environs include 4 main islands, and the sunny rolling hills you navigate across the setting make for a game pace that feels somehow more relaxed than usual. The game’s hero usually feels some kind of pressing need to “become the best” in Pokémon games, but this time around, the atmosphere seems distinctly more chill, which is actually a welcome change since it puts more focus on things like battle mechanics.</p><p>The world also seems both more contained and more expansive, all at once. The islands occupy a more specific and manageable virtual space, making it easier to navigate by memory, but the angle of the camera while you’re walking around, the spacing of towns, trainers and tall grass patches and other subtle changes make circumnavigation of the world seem more spread out than in games past, which again helps with this new atmosphere that’s prone to a more relaxed pace of game play.</p><p>The most startling change for longtime Pokémon fans might be that the Gym system of previous regions is gone from Sun and Moon. In its place, there’s a new Trial system, wherein you seek out locations where powerful Pokémon hold sway, and battle a series of weaker monsters to prepare for a battle with a single “totem” character who is more powerful. These aren’t controlled by trainers; they’re more like wild Pokémon you can’t catch.</p><p>Totem Pokémon can call in allies, which basically turns battles into a two-on-one situation, and not in your favor. This definitely ups the stakes, but it’s still very different from facing a number of trainers with multiple Pokémon each in a Gym in preparation for a battle with a leader at the top.</p><p>Defeating these totem Pokémon paves the way for you facing off against the “kahuna” of each island, in what’s called a Grand Trial. This is a more traditional trainer battle, and clearing this is essentially like clearing a Gym in the old game – it unlocks access to the next region, and renders rewards that allow you to control higher level Pokémon.</p><p>In place of badges are Z-Crystals, which are better in that they award you actual new abilities instead of just bragging rights. Z-Crystals will power up certain Pokémon moves, for one use per battle only, when held by Pokémon and activated using your trainer’s Z-Ring (plus a special dance move of some kind).</p><p>Using Z-Crystals is a lot like using Mega Evolutions in Pokémon X and Y – the only difference is that they’re single-use, whereas a Mega Evolution changes your Pokémon throughout the course of a battle. They amp up one move of a specific type, with each type of Z-Crystal applying to a different elemental Pokémon type. These are very powerful moves, and can definitely turn the tide of a battle if used intelligently.</p><p>Also new to Pokémon Sun and Moon is a system called Pokémon Refresh. This lets you pamper and feed your pets, as you would as a responsible human being in the real world. It’s a very Tamagotchi-like interface, which uses the touchscreen to let you clean up your creatures post-battle, or even heal status conditions like paralysis, sleep or a burn using just a wand, time and taps.</p><p>I actually love the inclusion of Refresh, because it means you can easily deal with status conditions out on the road when you’re far from a Pokémon Center, without having to burn through healing items or spend money to stockpile the same. Refresh takes time, but it’s a lot easier than traipsing all the way back to a Center in most cases, especially early on the in the game when your transport options are few.</p><p>Refresh also helps you boost your Pokémon through better bonding, but it’s something you can also safely ignore if you’d rather not spend the time. It’s exactly the type of side feature that I welcome in these games: additive, without being overly time consuming (as was Super Training) but also ultimately optional.</p><p>Also new in Pokémon Sun and Moon is an anthropomorphized Pokédex; your trainer is the lucky recipient of a Pokédex infused with an energy-based Pokémon, which turns it into a living thing. This is weird, but it’s typical Pokémon weird and it fits with the franchise.</p><p>The Pokémon-infused Rotom Pokédex then becomes a kind of tutorial helper, giving you tips throughout your journey and adding commentary at key plot points via the bottom screen. It can definitely be helpful, and in some ways makes more narrative sense than having random people call you or bump into you just to tell you some small thing about this particular fork in the road.</p><p>At the same time, I found myself being annoyed by Rotom more often than not – my Pokédex used to be a trusty, reliable tool, and now it was interjecting and saying random nonsense, sometimes when I wanted to actually use the thing most.</p><p>When you want to play with others, Pokémon Sun and Moon have also changed things up. The multiplayer features are mostly resident in the new Festival Plaza area, which is always available, and which includes a number of shops, its own currency cooperative missions and more.</p><p>Plaza is like an expanded version of the multiplayer features in X and Y, with a whole second world to explore that makes it seem more like a complete alternate game mode to the single-player campaign. It’s a rich world, and one that you can actually do a lot with even if you’re not actually engaging in any multiplay</p>",

    "content": "<p>India has a new tech unicorn. Hike, a four-year-old messaging app, today announced that it has closed $175 million in funding led by new investors Chinese internet giant Tencent and manufacturing firm Foxconn. The Series D round values the company at $1.4 billion, founder and CEO Kavin Bharti Mittal confirmed to TechCrunch.</p><p>Tencent, the company that pioneered messaging with WeChat, is the big name here, but existing investors Tiger Global, Bharti and SoftBank also took part in the round, which takes Hike to more than $250 million raised to date. Hike added some strategic U. S.-based investors to its roster earlier this year, but its last major funding was a $65 million Series C that closed two years ago.</p><p>“Hike deeply understands India; a highly diverse market with many nuances. It is on a mission synergistic to ours, which is to enhance the quality of human life through internet services. With our investment, Hike will be able to leverage our deep domain expertise in the messaging platform space to provide more value to its users in India,” Tencent President Martin Lau said in a prepared statement.</p><p>Born out of a joint-venture between Bharti and SoftBank, Hike includes standard messaging app features you’d expect, alongside free voice calling and a few other twists. It has put emphasis on local users with features that include a privacy option to hide chat messages, in case a nosey relative gets hold of your phone as can happen in India, and the ability to send messages via SMS to friends who aren’t using the Hike app, another foreseeable usecase in the country.</p><p>Targeting young people, it has played up to a fun and hip image with its marketing and advertising campaigns.</p><p>Facebook-owned WhatsApp is the dominant chat app in India, with more than 100 million active users in the country, around one-tenth of its total userbase. Hike announced earlier this year that it has over 100 million registered users (i.e. downloads not necessary active), 90 percent of whom are aged under 30, with 40 billion messages exchanged on the service each month, but Bharti Mittal declined to provide an update on that data.</p><p>Despite WhatsApp dominating chat worldwide, the Hike chief is sure that his company’s app is fulfilling a much-needed gap.</p><p>“Every market has two messaging apps that do well,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch. “There’s one that replaces SMS and one that does a lot more than that. Hike doesn’t even compete with WhatsApp today, it is used very actively in addition to other apps.”</p><p>For the past year or so, Hike has been focused on building in that differentiation with WhatsApp which, despite adding voice calls last year and promising to introduce business accounts in the future, has largely retained a bare-basics approach to chat. That has enabled people of all backgrounds and comfort with technology to adopt WhatsApp — which saw its message volumes pass global SMS numbers long ago — but it has left an option for a more integrated and sophisticated messaging app — something that acts like a modern-day internet portal for mobile.</p><p>Seizing that opportunity, which Bharti Mittal believes lies with the youth, Hike has integrated mobile games, a news service, coupons (beta) and localized stickers into Hike. Games attract over 100 million play sessions per month — 20-25 million per day — while the news feature has 50 million-plus users and sees 1.5 billion stories viewed a month, he said of the early signs of traction.</p><p>That approach to going beyond chat makes the involvement of Tencent in this round hugely important. The Chinese company pioneered the ‘swiss army knife’ approach to messaging with WeChat, China’s dominant messaging app with over 700 million users which has integrated e-commerce, food delivery, taxi apps and much more. WeChat is often compared to a mobile operating system such is its influence and importance in China.</p><p>The WeChat influence is strong. Even Facebook is among those to embrace its approach with Messenger and, like the U. S. social network giant, that’s the path Hike aims to go down.</p><p>Bharti Mittal, whose billionaire father Sunil Bharti Mittal founded telecom giant Bharti, explained that to me Hike is likely to introduce a payment solution within the next six to twelve months, among other things.</p><p>“This is the very early form of what is possible, you’ll see us invest more in services going forward,” he added.</p><p>Tencent has invested in other messaging apps, Snapchat and Kik in the U. S., but its deal with Hike is notable for being its largest investment in India to date. (It led a $90 million investment into Bangalore-based medical portal Practo last year.) Given the focus that Alibaba, Tencent’s fierce rival, is putting into India with investments in Paytm (payments) and Snapdeal (e-commerce), you could be forgiven for seeing the Hike deal as Tencent’s first move to replicate its chat-based empire in India, the planet’s other billion-person-plus population.</p><p>Not so. This isn’t the prelude to an acquisition, according to Bharti Mittal.</p><p>“Operationally nothing changes, there’s no discussion around integration,” he explained. “Tencent has a minority stake… our goal is to make the partnership a key success, [there’s] no-one better than Tencent because they are the best at what they do.”</p><p>The fact that WeChat has largely failed in India, despite Tencent putting some serious money into marketing the app via commercials and partnerships a couple of years ago, nullifies the complication of any competition, the Hike CEO said.</p><p>“WeChat is not as much of a competitor today, and I think they’ve seen that,” he added. “We spoke to them very early on when they came to India to work on their own product, [but] it was too early to invest [then] and they wanted to [work by] themselves. [The investment today] happened as we built a relationship over the past few years.”</p><p>Tencent is the standout name in the Series D round, but Bharti Mittal also played up the importance of Foxconn, anoth</p>",

Of course, there are already a number of ways to text friends your favorite music, thanks to the launch of the iMessage App Store. Apple Music has a built-in iMessage app, for example, and Pandora also rolled out one of its own earlier this month. However, these apps are limited because they work best for those who are already using the given service, or have the appropriate app installed.</p><p>Pandora’s iMessage app will kick non-users over the App Store to download it, if the recipient doesn’t have its app installed on their device. Plus, because it’s a music radio service, when your friend taps the track you’ve sent, it only plays a 30-second sample.</p><p>And if you want to interact with the track further, you tap it to start a Pandora artist station. This isn’t exactly the ideal way to share a song you want your friend to listen to it in its entirety.</p><p>SoundShare’s app works around the problem of people using different music services by giving your friend the option as to where they want to hear the song.</p><p>By default, the recipient can choose to launch the song’s video on YouTube; stream it through Apple Music, if they’re a subscriber; or launch iTunes to hear the preview, and optionally purchase it or the album.</p><p>Unfortunately, though SoundShare itself works with Spotify (Premium) and Deezer, these are not options in the iMessage app – you can only launch the track to stream in full on SoundShare, if you’ve previously connected Spotify or Deezer to your SoundShare account.</p><p>The new iMessage app arrived in a recent update to SoundShare’s flagship iOS app, which debuted earlier this year. The main application offers a music social network of sorts, where you can find and follow others, create collaborative playlists, or view your friends’ playlists – no matter which music service they’ve chosen to use.</p><p>But the iMessage app is what makes SoundShare worth the install, really. It’s a better experience than just texting a YouTube link, which is what many people do today when sharing music over text messaging.</p><p>Once installed, you can access SoundShare from the apps screen in iMessage. The interface offers a list of the Top 100 songs on its social network, which is useful if you want to see what’s trending and popular. However, it doesn’t have separate sections for songs by genre or new releases. Instead, you just type in what you’re looking for using the search bar, then tap the song to send it to your friend.</p><p>The result is a much improved experience for the recipient versus getting a YouTube link, as SoundShare displays an image thumbnail alongside a link that will offer all the streaming options.</p><p>SoundShare’s new iMessage app is a free download from the iTunes App Store, and works on iOS 10 and higher.</p>",

Sadly, this feature also currently only works in the Duolingo iPhone app. Given that the bots’ intelligence resides in the cloud, you’ll have to be connected to the Internet to use this feature.</p><p>To make talking to the bots a bit more compelling, the company tried to give its different bots a bit of personality. There’s Chef Robert, Renée the Driver and Officer Ada, for example. They will react differently to your answers (and correct you as necessary), but for the most part, the idea here is to mimic a real conversation.</p><p>These bots also allow for a degree of flexibility in your answers that most language-learning software simply isn’t designed for. There are plenty of ways to greet somebody, for example, but most services will often only accept a single answer. When you’re totally stumped for words, though, Duolingo offers a “help my reply” button with a few suggested answers.</p><p>“One of the main reasons people learn languages is to have conversations,” writes Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn in today’s announcement. “Students master vocabulary and comprehension skills with  Duolingo, but coming up with things to say in real­-life situations remains daunting. Bots offer a  sophisticated and effective answer to that need.”</p><p>For now, you can only use text chat to talk to the bots. Over time, Duolingo plans to allow for spoken conversations as well, though.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The law firm Fenwick & West quietly released its third-quarter venture capital survey this past Friday, and its findings aren’t exactly shocking. At the same time, they hint at problems to come for some startups.</p><p>The survey, which analyzed the valuations and terms of financings for 149 Bay Area companies that raised capital in the third quarter, showed that 71 percent of those financings were “up” rounds, meaning the price per share of the company increased over its last round. Another 14 percent were down rounds, meaning the opposite happened, and 15 percent were “flat,” so the companies’ valuations didn’t change, despite that they raised more funding.</p><p>The picture was almost exactly the same as in the second quarter of the year, when 74 percent of rounds were up rounds and 13 percent were flat, but the third-quarter marks the fourth quarter in a row that venture valuation metrics have declined, which has the survey’s author, attorney Barry Kramer, following the development closely.</p><p>“It’s not like things have fallen dramatically,” he told us by phone on Friday. “Basically, we were close to all-time highs in 2014 and 2015, and valuations are now at their 12-year averages, so you could argue that we’re in a healthy regression to the mean.”</p><p>Of greater concern to Kramer is that the number of deals has also gone down over the past four quarters. In the second quarter, for example, Fenwick was able to analyze 195 financings for Silicon Valley companies — or 30 percent more than in the third quarter.</p><p>That could mean that only stronger companies are getting financed. At the same time, it does raise questions about what happens to all the startups that raised funds in 2014 and 2015 and haven’t raised again. “Are they kind of starting to run on fumes, and we’re a quarter or so away from seeing something more dramatic?” Kramer asks. “I’d feel better if deal volumes weren’t falling.”</p><p>You can check out the entire survey here.</p>",

    "content": "<p>For years, a truism in software investing was that the value of application software lies in data, not in technology. Companies like Salesforce, Workday, and ServiceNow are valuable because they are the “system of record” (SoR), or single source of truth, for their customers’ most valuable information, such as customer records or employee data.</p><p>As a result, they become deeply embedded in their customers’ business processes, making them hard to rip out. That gives them tremendous revenue predictability and pricing power. The technology itself — databases combined with workflow engines — is not particularly innovative; it’s the information captured by the technology that’s important.</p><p>The newest crop of software applications turns this logic on its head. They mimic consumer companies by using technology as a “wedge” to gain widespread adoption and don’t even try to become systems of record.</p><p>Instead, they are “systems of engagement” (SoE), meaning apps that employees actually use to get their work done. For example, take Slack, which Forbes recently identified as the most valuable private cloud company.</p><p>The data in Slack is either low value (“water-cooler” conversations) or already lives in existing systems of record. The same is true for many other fast-growing apps, like Intercom (customer interaction), Clari (sales), Culture Amp (employee feedback) and Front (shared inbox).</p><p>Digging deeper, the specific areas of technology where these companies have innovated are ones that historically people have ignored — integration and design.</p><p>At big companies, integration is the ugly step-child of any product roadmap: everyone wants it to work, but no one wants to work on it. Here’s an example: a senior executive at a leading SaaS company tells me that twenty people from different groups across the company show up for the “billing meeting”, where it’s decided how billing will integrate with core features. But no one wants to work on the billing team, creating those integrations.</p><p>Startups have capitalized on that by creating high performance, scalable integrations, solving hard technical problems like how to sync without putting excessive load on the underlying system.</p><p>Entire companies, such as our portfolio company Okta, for single sign-on, or Segment, for analytics, are now built on integration alone.</p><p>Integration companies, while not glamorous, can build market power by positioning themselves at the center of an ecosystem and creating an “ecosystem network effect”, whereby they become a de facto standard. Okta and Segment are both on their way to achieving this.</p><p>But most new applications use integration to gather, organize, and analyze data. They win the hearts of their users through great design. That’s no small challenge, given growing data sets, shrinking screen sizes, and ever shorter attention spans, which is why the concept of design has become a huge differentiator.</p><p>It works because it’s a win-win. Startups creating systems of engagement get users and revenue, by leveraging data in the systems of record. They also increase the data’s value, by using it more and adding to it. That makes the big software vendors happy, as (they believe) it increases their customer lock-in and helps them become more of a platform.</p><p>What’s not clear is whether this will continue. Large companies like Salesforce want to innovate through technology. For example, the center-piece at this month’s Dreamforce, its annual conference, is a new artificial intelligence (AI) initiative marketed as “Einstein”, which layers predictive models over its existing applications.</p><p>Conversely, once a startup’s product is being used every day like Slack, it may start keeping more information within it and over time wean people off whatever they were using before (Outlook, Sharepoint, etc).</p><p>The game-changer could well be artificial intelligence: if AI software could extract signal from the unstructured product feedback in Intercom or the sales forecasting information in Clari, the data in those systems could become more valuable than the limited fields captured in today’s systems of record.</p><p>But that’s a long way off. For current startups, the message is clear. Don’t try to be Salesforce to Seibel, Workday to Peoplesoft or Coupa to Ariba. Those battles are over, and won’t be repeated. Instead, use technology — integration, design, perhaps machine learning or AI — as your wedge into the market.</p><p>Play nice with existing systems, and then analyze how people are using your product. Feed that back into new product development and drive more engagement, ideally creating a virtuous cycle between usage and design that keeps you ahead of competitors.</p><p>For examples of who does this well, look no further than the large consumer companies. It’s no coincidence that the two most awe-inspiring enterprise businesses today (AWS and Google Apps) both have a consumer heritage.</p><p>That’s the winning strategy for today, and most likely tomorrow.</p>",

    "content": "<p>You know what’s cooler than a (several hundred) million users? A billion users.</p><p>Just over a week after announcing the scrapping of the Facebook-owned messaging service’s $0.99 annual fee, WhatsApp announced today that the product now has 1 billion users. The timing of the WhatsApp news may have been calculated: it comes on the same day that Google announced 1 billion users of Gmail. While Google has floundered on social networking services it’s shown to have a deft hand at growing a communication network in the form of email, making it Google’s most viable competitor against messaging apps at the moment.</p><p>The milestone was announced on WhatsApp’s official blog today. This means that WhatsApp acquired around 100 million users between now and September 2015, when the company reported to have 900 million active users.</p><p>According to a profile in WIRED Magazine last week, though, the WhatsApp featured 990 million users at that time. Adding 10 million users between late last month and today – in under two weeks – is indeed impressive, and it will be interesting to see if the company can keep up this pace as their user base grows bigger and bigger.</p><p>Despite these impressive user numbers, WhatsApp’s capability to generate revenue is once again in question after the company scrapped the $0.99 fee, which at the time of the company’s acquisition by Menlo Park-based Facebook, Inc. totaled $10.2 million annually, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>While revenue still remains an open question, it will be interesting to see how this massive user number impacts the playing field in a saturated messaging market. As WhatsApp plans to move into the Business-To-Consumer (B2C) communications market and tries to deploy end-to-end encryption, the product will come head-to-head with competitors like Telegram and Facebook’s own Messenger, which boasts a cool 800 million users independently.</p>",

    "content": "<p>As promised earlier this year, Google is bringing RCS – Rich Communications Service, an upgrade to the SMS standard – to Android devices. Its first carrier partner on the initiative is Sprint, which is rolling out RCS messaging to its customers with Android devices, starting today. Once enabled, RCS will offer Android users an enhanced messaging experience over SMS, with features like better group chats, high-resolution photo sharing, read receipts and typing indicators.</p><p>Google announced its plans to move in this direction when it acquired RCS provider Jibe Mobile back in September 2015. The Jibe cloud platform will power the new service on Sprint, says Google.</p><p>Sprint subscribers will have their standard SMS experience upgraded through Google’s redesigned Messenger app on their Android devices, provided they are on Android KitKat or higher, and have set Messenger as their default SMS application.</p><p>Those using select LG and Nexus phones from Sprint will be automatically upgraded to RCS through an app update, while others can manually update their devices by downloading the Messenger app from the Play Store.</p><p>Google’s new Pixel-branded smartphones come with Messenger pre-loaded, so if a customer is using an unlocked device on the Sprint network and has Messenger installed, it will also have access to RCS.</p><p>Beginning next year, all new Android devices from Sprint will come with Messenger preloaded as the default SMS and RCS messaging app, says Google.</p><p>For consumers who gain access to the new messaging experience on Sprint Android phones, they’ll be able to take advantage of features that rival Apple’s iMessage or other third-party messaging apps. For example, though MMS today supports group messaging, you can’t do some of the things people now expect – like naming the group, adding new members, or leaving an existing group. That will change with RCS.</p><p>In addition, Sprint users will be able to share 100x larger images and videos than was possible with MMS, will know if messages are delivered or read, and will see typing indicators when someone is writing to you.</p><p>RCS, as a technology, has been around since 2007, but it has only been launched by 49 carriers worldwide, according to the GSMA. However, the organization says that Sprint is the first to launch the new RCS profile initiative – the other launches involved older iterations on the standard.</p><p>This is also the first time Google itself has rolled out RCS support anywhere in the world. (The now Google-owned Jibe platform, of course, had previously supported older versions of RCS, however.)</p><p>While positioned to some extent as a way Google can compete with iMessage, the problem with RCS is that it’s not universally adopted. Unlike with iMessage, which works with any Apple device, RCS is made available by carriers, and it won’t work on older Android smartphones. In other words, the impact of this launch – for now, at least – is limited.</p><p>Google says it has plans to launch RCS with other carrier partners in the “coming months,” but won’t speak to which ones, or when.</p><p>In the meantime, the move seems to muddle Google’s messaging ambitions even further. After all, where is Google placing its bets these days?</p><p>To take advantage of RCS, Android users on supported devices have to use Google’s Messenger app as their default client. But, at the same time, Google continues to offer its Hangouts chat and calling app, and it’s promoting its new Allo app as the future of messaging, thanks to its integrated A. I. assistant. Allo also comes pre-installed on Google’s new Pixel smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL. (Hangouts can be set as the default SMS app, Allo cannot).</p><p>Allo does work cross-platform – as does Duo, its video counterpart – but they are both rather late entries into larger messaging market, where third-party apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and others now dominate.</p><p>And, in terms of competing with iMessage, Google simply doesn’t have the same infrastructure in play.</p><p>By owning the entire platform – from hardware to software – Apple is able to lock users into its own iMessage ecosystem on any Apple device. And now, it’s even running a new App Store on top of that platform.</p><p>Google may be able to convince more carriers to roll out RCS in the future, but that will take time. And the technology won’t be as front-and-center as iMessage is in Apple’s world, as users on supported devices have to upgrade their apps, switch their default settings, and/or upgrade from older Android phones to use it. In the meantime, fragmentation will continue among RCS and non-RCS Android devices, not to mention Google’s own growing number of alternative messaging apps it can’t seem to stop creating.</p>",

    "content": "<p>While it would have been nice to tackle this issue before the election, Google and Facebook are finally taking a tiny step in order to fight back against fake news. According to multiple statements, both companies have updated their policies to ban fake news sites from using Facebook’s and Google’s advertising networks.</p><p>With the U. S. election, fake news became incredibly popular on social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, as well as news aggregating services, such as Google News and news articles in Google search results. We’re not talking about opinion articles — we’re talking about reports spreading blatantly inaccurate information.</p><p>Google first updated its policy saying that the company will try to ban sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” Websites who don’t comply with this rule will get banned from using Google AdSense.</p><p>When it comes to Facebook, the company has also updated its policy to rule out fake news sites from using Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>Google AdSense and Facebook Audience Network let content publishers display ads on their websites. Google and Facebook manage the ad inventories, content publishers get a cut for clicks or impressions.</p><p>Both companies already have strict policies for their ad networks. For instance, you can’t use Google AdSense on a porn website. Google uses a combination of algorithms and human moderation to decide whether a site is eligible to use its advertising service.</p><p>By removing a potential revenue stream, it makes the business of fake news a bit less lucrative. For instance, Buzzfeed discovered that more than 100 fake news sites were created in a tiny city in Macedonia. So it’s clear that it’s not just about influencing the election — people are taking advantage of social networks to make money using fake news.</p><p>But there will always be alternative revenue streams, so this move is not enough. Reducing the reach of these websites is the best way to prevent fake news sites from popping out. If Facebook, Twitter, Google News and other websites flagged fake news appropriately, then there would be no reason to create fake news sites in the first place.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Adobe held its annual MAX conference for users of its Creative Cloud earlier this month. That’s where the company usually announces new and upcoming features to applications like Photoshop or Premiere Pro. This year, however, Adobe also introduced Sensei, its new artificial intelligence- and machine learning-based platform that combines Adobe’s knowledge of working with photos, videos, documents and marketing data with a unified AI and machine learning framework.</p><p>Just like Microsoft and Google are trying to imbue all of their products with “intelligence,” Adobe, too, is now on a mission to bring more smarts to its products — be that in the form of machine learning-based tools and features, or through smarter traditional analytics. Sensei is Adobe’s version of this. The framework will find its way into all of Adobe’s products — not just its Creative Cloud tools, but maybe even more importantly its Marketing and Document Cloud services, as well. In addition, the company plans to open these services to ISVs and developers through APIs that will allow them to build the same features into their own applications.</p><p>In its current form, Sensei powers Adobe’s “search by image” features in Photoshop and Adobe Stock, for example (this is similar to Google Images’ “search by image” tool). The company wants the public to see Sensei as its “unified AI framework.”</p><p>“At the top-most level, we have always been focused around what are the set of technology investments and product investments we can make that are ultimately aimed at improving the digital experience — whether that’s the consumer experience on the creative side or the product we build to serve marketers,” Adobe CEO Abhay Parasnis told me. “We are a deep technology product company but it has to be in service of really driving the experience innovation across the three products: Creative, Marketing and Document Cloud.” Sensei, he argues, is one of the company’s “most strategic bets that we rolled out this week by far — not just in terms of what it is today but because of the profound impact we expect it will have over the next five to ten years — not just for our products but actually more importantly for customers.”</p><p>Parasnis described Sensei as a “continuously learning system which learns from users’ behavior — it learns from what users are doing with our products across the full suite.” He also stressed that Sensei brings together the two parts of Adobe — that is, its creative and analytical sides.</p><p>On the technical side, Parasnis noted that the company uses lots of open-source tools like Spark, Torch and TensorFlow and then combines those into a unified framework that trains its models. He believes that the most successful intelligence systems in the next decade will be the ones that have very deep domain knowledge. For Adobe, that obviously means creativity, document productivity and customer journey and customer experience. “Unlike any other AI framework — whether real or just a fake announcement — our view is to lead with deep services that show as end-user consumable behavior,” Parasnis said. He cited Photoshop’s Face-Aware Liquify, Document Cloud’s ability to find similar documents and similar tools as examples of where Adobe already surfaces Sensei’s capabilities.</p><p>Parasnis acknowledged that companies like Google and Microsoft may look like competitors, but he argues that their platforms are more horizontal while Adobe plans to go very deep. Indeed, he told me to expect to see Sensei work with Microsoft’s infrastructure, as well — which of course isn’t a surprise, given that Adobe has recently announced it is betting on Microsoft Azure as its preferred public cloud provider.</p><p>Talking about cloud, Parasnis told me that he believes the company will be able to leverage the advances in public clouds to power a lot of this innovation. “Long term, the move to public cloud is inevitable,” he said. But while Adobe runs a small number of its own data centers, which are at least partially powered by the open source OpenStack platform, it’s not planning to shut them down either, though. Parasnis noted that a lot of Adobe’s services — especially around its analytics and Marketing Cloud service — need to have very dependable latency and the ability to deliver sub-second experiences. At least for the next few years, he doesn’t expect this to change. “We now have one of the most complicated and complex cloud infrastructures across public, private and our own data centers,” he believes.</p>",

    "content": "<p>With 700 million Messenger users, investors are eager to see Facebook earn money on the platform. But Zuckerberg put the brakes on those expectations today during the Q2 earnings call, explaining that Messenger and WhatsApp will run the same monetization playbook as Facebook and the News Feed: Get people organically interacting with businesses before you let companies pay to reach customers.</p><p>Here’s how Zuck laid out the plan:</p><p>“If you go back to 2006 and 2007, there were a lot of people that were encouraging us to just put banner ads and inorganic content into the experience” Zuckerberg sad. “And what we decided was that over the long-term, the ads and monetization would perform better if there was an organic interaction between people using the product and businesses.”</p><p>So instead, Facebook launched Pages, allowing businesses to set up a free presence on the social network. It asked users to subscribe to News Feed posts from businesses they cared about, and provide Insights analytics so companies could track the impact of their Pages. Once people were accustomed to businesses in the feed, it slowly started letting businesses pay to amplify the reach of “Sponsored Stories” to people whose friends had interacted with their brand. Eventually, it introduced more flexible News Feed ads, and most recently, auto-play video ads.</p><p>If it had jumped right to flashy banners or paid commercials, users could have balked, ditched the News Feed, and Facebook could have ruined its future revenue engine. Instead, usage kept growing and dollars came with time.</p><p>Zuck wants to do the same thing with Messenger and WhatsApp.</p><p>Surely, businesses would love to just unilaterally message users directly because engagement and attention to Messenger and WhatsApp is so strong. But that could hamper Facebook’s chat apps’ lightning-fast growth.</p><p>Instead, it’s working to slowly allow users to volunteer to interact with businesses through its chat apps.</p><p>Messenger recently launched an apps and games platform. The Businesses On Messenger program that debuted at F8 and is slowly rolling out, allows users to opt to get customer support after e-commerce purchases over Messenger rather than through email. WhatsApp already allows businesses to set up accounts that they can use to send content or marketing messages to people who connect with them.</p><p>Done right, users will get comfortable interacting with businesses over chat, and then it can start charging brands for that opportunity. Zuck concluded this argument asking for patience from Wall Street, saying “The long-term bet is that by enabling people to have good organic interactions with businesses, that will end up being a massive multiplier on the value of the monetization down the road.”</p><p>Essentially, if it’s still growing fast, don’t choke it with monetization.</p><p>The plan worked phenomenally for Facebook. Hundreds of millions of people got addicted to the News Feed and started subscribing to Pages before the company peppered the feed with ads. Now it’s earning over $4 billion per quarter. The same strategy could make using Facebook’s messaging apps and talking to businesses there a natural part of the experience. Then it can start squeezing dollars out of chat.</p>",

GE Ventures had been an investor in the company as part of the $82 million Series F round in 2015.</p><p>The two companies have more in common than you might think. GE is building the Predix Platform, on top of which it hopes companies will build applications that take advantage of sensor data coming off of Internet of Things-connected devices. GE has made a huge bet on the Industrial Internet of Things, using data on huge machines like MRI machines, wind turbines and airplane engines to give customers the data they need to proactively maintain these mega systems.</p><p>In fact, when I spoke to Athani Krishnaprasad, co-founder and chief innovation officer at ServiceMax recently, we talked about a future vision where sensors on IoT devices fed information to companies, allowing them to build entirely new business models. In Krishnaprasad’s vision for his company, a hospital would subscribe to an MRI machine instead of buying it and pay for guaranteed up time instead of the physical hardware.</p><p>It would be up to the vendor to proactively monitor the device and keep it up and running. Data coming from sensors would let the company know when a part was about to break or that it was time for regular maintenance. He called this “outcome-based services.”</p><p>“Analyzing the data to change business process to gain efficiencies or service customers better is a big win,” Krishnaprasad explained.</p><p>And as GE transforms from a company simply selling those big machines to one that fits so well with ServiceMax’s future world view, the two companies coming together makes so much sense.</p><p>“This acquisition builds upon our ongoing efforts to enhance our overall technology stack around the Predix platform and advance our Industrial Internet vision,” Bill Ruh, GE Digital CEO said in a statement. “Improved productivity is critical for the Industrial Internet and digitizing field services is a cornerstone of a successful digital industrial strategy,” he added.</p><p>ServiceMax CEO Dave Yarnold says this move gives his company resources he couldn’t imagine, and he still gets to run it as a separate entity within the larger organization. “Bill [Ruh] wants to run this as a separate business and really invest it. We want to build an operating system for the service economy. To be able to accelerate that and work with one of the best companies in the world and increase investment in the marketing and the product, it allows us to accelerate that vision — and I’m excited about taking that forward.</p><p>ServiceMax has raised over $200 million since it was founded in 2007. It would seem on its face, that getting $915 million for the company is a pretty decent return for its investors.</p>",

GE has made a huge bet on the Industrial Internet of Things, using data on huge machines like MRI machines, wind turbines and airplane engines to give customers the data they need to proactively maintain these mega systems.</p><p>In fact, when I spoke to Athani Krishnaprasad, co-founder and chief innovation officer at ServiceMax recently, we talked about a future vision where sensors on IoT devices fed information to companies, allowing them to build entirely new business models. In Krishnaprasad’s vision for his company, a hospital would subscribe to an MRI machine instead of buying it and pay for guaranteed up time instead of the physical hardware.</p><p>It would be up to the vendor to proactively monitor the device and keep it up and running. Data coming from sensors would let the company know when a part was about to break or that it was time for regular maintenance. He called this “outcome-based services.”</p><p>“Analyzing the data to change business process to gain efficiencies or service customers better is a big win,” Krishnaprasad explained.</p><p>And as GE transforms from a company simply selling those big machines to one that fits so well with ServiceMax’s future world view, the two companies coming together makes so much sense.</p><p>“This acquisition builds upon our ongoing efforts to enhance our overall technology stack around the Predix platform and advance our Industrial Internet vision,” Bill Ruh, GE Digital CEO said in a statement. “Improved productivity is critical for the Industrial Internet and digitizing field services is a cornerstone of a successful digital industrial strategy,” he added.</p><p>ServiceMax CEO Dave Yarnold says this move gives his company resources he couldn’t imagine, and he still gets to run it as a separate entity within the larger organization. “Bill [Ruh] wants to run this as a separate business and really invest it. We want to build an operating system for the service economy. To be able to accelerate that and work with one of the best companies in the world and increase investment in the marketing and the product, it allows us to accelerate that vision — and I’m excited about taking that forward.</p><p>ServiceMax has raised over $200 million since it was founded in 2007. It would seem on its face, that getting $915 million for the company is a pretty decent return for its investors.</p>",

During an especially rough quarter, local handset maker Xiaomi’s shipment dipped significantly from 17.1 to 10.5 million year over year, according to the firm.</p><p>The 38 percent drop was enough to knock the company down to the fourth position, as Huawei took over the top spot with 19.1 million units moved, comprising 17.2 percent of the country’s massive market share. Huawei was followed closely by fellow domestic manufacturers OPPO and Vivo, at 18 and 14.7 million units, respectively.</p><p>For its part, Xiaomi has disputed IDC’s numbers, pointing to higher estimates from other prominent research firms, though all noted numbers significantly below Q2 2015’s 17 million.</p><p>The highest spot by a non-domestic company on IDC’s list was secured by Apple, which rounded out the top five with 8.6 million shipments, also down fairly significantly (31.7 percent) from 12.6 the year prior.</p>",

The company announced that it is releasing a hardbound photo book showcasing some of the most iconic Apple designs from the last 20 years.</p><p>The book will be released tomorrow on Apple.com and in flagship American Apple stores. They will be available in two sizes. The small one will cost $199 while the big one will cost $299. It is dedicated to Steve Jobs.</p><p>The cover of the book is completely white with an embossed Apple logo on the front cover. You can read “Designed by Apple in California” on the spine — the title is embossed as well.</p><p>Based on the photos on Apple’s website, the book doesn’t contain any text. It’s a collection of 450 photos shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman. There’s no background and products seem to float in the air. It starts with the first iMac in 1998 and ends with the Apple Pencil in 2015.</p><p>This could be a nice present for the holidays, and it’ll definitely shine in Apple stores. But Apple is a technology company. It seems a bit weird that the company would release a photo book.</p><p>First, Apple likes to say that it rarely looks back and only moves forward. A book dedicated to products that you can’t even buy in Apple stores is odd.</p><p>Second, releasing a book that shows that you’re awesome isn’t the coolest move ever. Sure, Apple likes to brag and say that “this is the biggest update in iPhone history” during press conferences. But it serves a purpose — selling more products.</p><p>Finally, the press release quotes Apple’s Chief Design Officer Jony Ive quite a lot. The book starts with the iMac, which happens to be Jony Ive’s first design assignment at Apple.</p><p>This book seems like Ive’s pet project, showcasing his own work at Apple. In particular, you won’t find the Apple II or Macintosh. It won’t change the face of the company, but it’s definitely an odd product. It shows that Apple’s corporate culture is changing.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Facebook will now allow businesses to deliver automated customer support, e-commerce guidance, content and interactive experiences through chatbots. By providing utility through its huge developer and business ecosystem, Facebook could boost loyalty with Messenger, one-up SMS and keep up with chat competitors like Kik, Line and Telegram that have their own bot platforms.</p><p>This confirms TechCrunch’s scoops from January that Facebook was working with chatbot developers, and last week that a program for automated agents would launch at F8. [Update: the official name for the platform is “bots on Messenger” not “agents on Messenger,” which was a previous codename.]</p><p>Facebook announced a slew of chatbot partnerships with developers who got early access, like 1-800-Flowers, so you can order flowers by just sending its Messenger bot a friend’s name. Or CNN could send you a “daily digest” of stories that match your interests, and skip the topics you don’t care about.</p><p>Zuckerberg explained that with AI and natural language processing combined with human help, people will be able to talk to Messenger bots just like they talk to friends.</p><p>For more on what F8 really means, read my thought piece: Facebook Alive</p><p>Through the Messenger Platform’s new Send/Receive API, bots can send more than just text. They will be able to respond with structured messages that include images, links and call to action buttons. These could let users make a restaurant reservation, review an e-commerce order and more. You can swipe through product carousels and pop out to the web to pay for a purchase.</p><p>Importantly, Facebook’s Messenger Platform currently doesn’t allow payments directly through a credit card added to Messenger.</p><p>A new persistent search bar at the top of Messenger will help people discover bots. For companies already connecting with customers over SMS, a phone-number matching tool will let them easily shift those conversations to people’s Messenger account instead, thanks to a partnership with Twilio. To keep people on control, a block button appears at the top of every bot conversation so you can easily silence them.</p><p>Developers will be able to build their own bots or work with Facebook’s bot-building partners. But Facebook also has its own Bot Engine built on its acquisition of natural language interface startup Wit.ai. Based on the same system Facebook uses to teach its own artificial intelligence M, developers can feed the Bot Engine sample conversations and it will learn how to handle similar conversations on its own.</p><p>Chatbots have suddenly become the biggest thing in tech. They unlock the ability to provide personalized, interactive communication akin to talking to a human customer service or sales rep, but at scale for much cheaper than call centers.</p><p>A conservative estimate is that chatbots could replace 1-800 numbers, offering more comfortable customer support experiences without the hassle of synchronous phone conversations, hold times and annoying phone trees.</p><p>But if bots on Messenger and other chatbot platforms thrive, they could redefine how businesses sell products and services. Instead of wandering around an app, a chatbot could ask your criteria and surface relevant things to buy. Rather than sifting through tons of content on a news site, a chatbot could learn what you like and deliver personal digests and suggestions.</p><p>Currently, Facebook has been keeping its acquisition WhatsApp as a cleaner messaging experience while experimenting with content and commerce on its own chat app. But if bots on Messenger succeed, Facebook could potentially allow chatbots on WhatsApp, which currently shuts them down.</p><p>The chatbot platform is no charity. Facebook also plans to earn money by allowing businesses to send “Sponsored Messages” ads to people who’ve already voluntarily started a conversation with a business. Advertisers can also buy “Click To Message” News feed ads that initiate a conversation with their bot. Both could allow bots to push people to buy products to recoup the ad costs.</p><p>Facebook sure isn’t the only chatbot game in town, but because of Messenger’s 900 million user reach, its vast connections with advertisers and a healthy developer ecosystem built over years, it might provide the most attractive platform on which to run them. Businesses focus where the biggest number of customers are, and it doesn’t get any bigger than Facebook.</p>",

Early users include hotel chain Hilton.</p><p>Several features were unveiled today. First of all, businesses can use the Fabric developer platform to link up a customer’s phone number or Twitter credentials to that customer’s account with that business. You do this in the CRM backend, but then when the customer service rep sees the user on Twitter via an enterprise client, it will automatically link the two. Twitter is showing off how it works with Oracle, one of the company’s early partners, for its customer care effort.</p><p>This will then follow through to how companies are able to track users’ interactions with their brand over Twitter, a thread of tweets that can better indicate whether the customer is having a persistent problem, or whatever other history there may be.</p><p>Twitter Announces New Tools, Partnerships For Finding And Publishing Embedded Tweets</p><p>Twitter Introduces Gnip Insights APIs To Help Brands Better Understand Audiences And Content</p><p>Twitter Adds 8 New Services To Its Fabric Platform, Which Is Used By 225,000+ Developers</p><p>Twitter's Fabric Announces Unity SDK Support, Error Logging On iOS And tvOS</p><p>The other area that is getting turned on today is something Twitter refers to as “single-tweet resolutions” — essentially because a user’s Twitter account will be linked up with their customer account, the customer service rep will be able to see that customer’s purchase history and offer much more direct and specific advice over Twitter in response to questions.</p><p>Twitter — with its fast-paced, real-time news stream and ability to send Tweets to any other account (except for those that make the effort block you) — all but dominates customer services on social media. The company says it about 80% of all requests come through its platform.</p><p>Chris Moody, who runs Twitter’s Gnip division, told TechCrunch in an interview that there are several benefits for businesses running customer service through Twitter. One is the basic ability to facilitate customer service to have the potential to work more easily and efficiently than older, legacy services like 1-800 numbers.</p><p>Moody claims that it’s one-sixth the cost to run these services on Twitter compared to other legacy channels. The other is the fact that for Twitter, it’s a way of getting closer to these businesses as clients, who might then choose to turn to Twitter for other things, like their marketing activities.</p>",

S. businesses that suffer if President-elect Donald Trump plays hardball with China over trade.</p><p>That’s according to an editorial from China’s state-run newspaper Global Times this weekend — via The Guardian — which included a thinly-veiled threat of repercussions if Trump takes action on pre-election comments. In September, Trump said he would impose a 45 percent tariff on imports from China if successfully elected.</p><p>Like many of Trump’s campaign comments, it remains to be seen what the incoming President’s policy will be. That hasn’t stopped the Global Times, one of China’s most notable government mouthpieces, from giving its take, however.</p><p>“China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U. S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” the paper wrote.</p><p>Global Times suggested that it is “a win-win situation” for all to maintain current agreements, and that there is too much at stake to do otherwise.</p><p>“Trump as a shrewd businessman will not be so naïve. None of the previous presidents were bold enough to launch an all-out trade war against China. They all opted for a cautious line since it’s most consistent with the overall interests of the U. S., and it’s most acceptable to U.S. society,” the editorial added.</p><p>The editorial was published right after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping communicated for the first time following the election result. Chinese media reported that the two have made plans to meet “at an early date.”</p><p>Apple, with its global reputation and vast wealth, is a popular target for politics. Trump has made choice comments on Apple and China in the past, demanding that the iPhone-maker produce its devices in its homeland rather than overseas. He also called for a boycott of its products after it rejected government requests to unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.</p><p>In a memo to staff sent after last week’s election, Apple CEO Tim Cook urged employees to “move forward together” in spite of the political division in America right now. Cook didn’t make mention of Trump by name, nor did he address the President-elect’s past comments about Apple.</p>",

Equality, Benioff said, has to be something that Salesforce stands for, just like it stands for growth, innovation, new ideas and creating new technology.</p><p>“[Equality] is a huge issue for the world,” Benioff said. “This is not just about Salesforce or the tech industry or just industries. We are in a world that we can see inequality everywhere we go. We know a lot about income inequality. We know a lot about racial inequality. We know about inequality with women. We know about LGBTQ inequality.”</p><p>He went on to say that inequality is a “multi-faceted beast” and that it’s something we all need to become experts on. Not just leaders like himself, but everyone.</p><p>“We’re fighting this beast,” Benioff said. “It’s out there.”</p><p>In order to fight the beast of inequality, Benioff said, we need to better understand why we’re seeing more inequality in the world. We also need to recognize that the solution to inequality is equality, he said.</p><p>In response to a question about his involvement in demanding that North Carolina repeal its anti-LGBT law, Benioff talked about the importance of seeing ourselves in each other.

    "content": "<p>Hollar, a startup offering dollar store-like finds in the form of a mobile app, has raised another $30 million to continue to grow its business. The new Series B round of funding was led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and included participation by Comcast Ventures and Greycroft Partners, as well existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners, Index Ventures, Forerunner Ventures, and Pritzker Group.</p><p>As a part of the deal, Eric Feng, General Partner at KPCB, will join Hollar’s board.</p><p>To date, Hollar has raised $47.5 million, following its prior $12 million Series A and $5.5 million seed rounds, which were closed only four months apart.</p><p>The company is tackling an interesting space – the super low price points where the majority of its merchandise has been around the $2 mark. During the first 10 months of its business, nothing was more than $5, but it’s now expanding into the $10 space for the holidays, which will allow it to sell more higher-quality toys and gifts.</p><p>Hollar, by way of background, got off the ground with The Honest Company’s CEO Brian Lee, who helped to develop the concept along with co-founder and CEO David Yeom, a former VP at Honest. Lee now serves as a board member, but isn’t involved day-to-day.</p><p>Says Yeom, people dismissed the idea that an online dollar store could be successful.</p><p>“When we were launching this business, people said there’s no way you can make money selling a $2 item!,” he laughs. But what the naysayers didn’t understand is how dollar store shoppers tend to buy – you don’t go into the store and buy a single $1 item. You load up your basket with dozens of the store’s cheaply priced products.</p><p>Similarly, Hollar’s shoppers do the same.</p><p>In fact, Yeom says that Hollar’s shoppers spend more than double the typical basket size at brick-and-mortar dollar stores, as its average basket size is around $30 to their $15. That means Hollar customers are buying around 10 items per order.</p><p>This is what led the shop to achieve over $1 million in sales in under six months, and see double-digit growth every month since.</p><p>This increased basket size, however, is in part due the fact that Hollar requires a $10 minimum purchase in order to check out, and free shipping only kicks in on orders over $25.</p><p>The company claims to have over 1 million registered users across web and mobile, but according to recent stats from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the iOS app in the U. S. has seen just 192,000 downloads to date. That said, the app is also available on Android, in addition to its online store.</p><p>However, what’s interesting is that Hollar claims half its customers are arriving via non-paid channels. This figure – indicating high word-of-mouth organic growth – seems high. But anecdotally, I’ve seen it myself. When I’ve told friends to download Hollar, the first thing they do is load up their basket with some $20+ worth of goods.</p><p>The Hollar store itself has been growing, along with its sales, the majority of which come from mobile.</p><p>Today, there are now over 10,000 live SKUs on its site and, by next month, around 300 of those will be Hollar’s own private label products. These include a number of home and kitchen items, electronics and accessories, and even, soon, a Hollar-branded VR viewer that works with your smartphone.</p><p>While Yeom won’t speak to the margins on Hollar’s private label items, he says they’re “substantially” higher than those from its vendors.</p><p>But there is one way where Hollar isn’t mirroring its retail dollar store rivals: grocery items. “That’s an area we’re not investing too much in – we want to stay true to the light and fun aspect,” says Yeom.</p><p>Private labels and careful product consideration aren’t the only ways Hollar is planning to grow its business. The other is the launch of a seller marketplace in the first quarter of 2017. Like Amazon and eBay, this will allow for direct sales from sellers to Hollar’s customers.</p><p>“If you truly want to scale, I think this is really the right approach,” says Yeom. “With any e-commerce business, inventory is a slippery slope. You have to be very mindful of it. This is definitely one way we can offer a greater depth and breadth of products.”</p><p>He notes that Hollar’s sellers will be vetted with a white glove approach, to keep quality high.</p><p>“We’re going to be very meticulous, very judicious about who sells…we want to make sure the experience is first and foremost,” Yeom explains. A seller rating and review system will arrive next year as well, to allow for consumer feedback.</p><p>Hollar, currently a team of over 150, also plans to increase its headcount as it moves its warehouse and corporate office from their prior separate locations into, ironically, the more than 180,000 square-foot former 99 Cents Only Stores facility. It also plans to explore an East Coast-based warehouse</p>",

It’s impossible to keep up.</p><p>For example, to match the pace of business required in today’s economy, General Electric (GE) is looking to embed technology in every function — from building and maintaining infrastructure to managing internal finances. To that end, the company created GE Digital in September 2015 to grow the company’s software and analytics business from $6 billion to a top 10 software company by 2020.</p><p>GE understands that to survive in today’s world of cloud, mobile, IoT and big data, central IT needs to evolve and operate under a new model that caters to evolving business needs. The new operating model requires a two-speed approach to IT and the business, as GE Digital CEO Bill Ruh noted in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>GE needs to act as a nimble startup by offering intuitive software and services yet still support traditional business units that move at a slower pace. This isn’t the traditional “we’re a startup within a large organization” slogan. GE is creating a new way of operating at the core of its business.</p><p>This new operating model requires IT to build reusable, self-service assets and infrastructure to avoid reinventing the wheel every time a project is delivered. Application programming interfaces (APIs), which are well-defined interfaces that allow diverse systems and software to talk with each other, are the key ingredient that brings everything together in an application network.</p><p>As a result, GE Digital built its cloud-based platform Predix to connect machines, data and people in real time for intelligent insights. For example, an airline company can regularly monitor machine and equipment health on the Predix platform and establish a proactive maintenance schedule to ensure safety, minimize downtime and extend asset life. By combining the physical and digital worlds, the 124-year-old GE is adapting its operating model with APIs to meet market demands and innovate more quickly than competition.</p><p>This new operating model also encourages businesses to become ecosystems, where developers both inside and outside the organization can build new value on existing capabilities. For instance, by giving outside developers free access to its APIs, Expedia Affiliate Network (EAN) allows its partners to directly access its technology platform and pull hotel rates, creating convenient user experiences and new revenue channels across third-party websites. Operating in this open, collaborative way, Expedia generates 90 percent of its revenue through APIs.</p><p>Additionally, at the end of 2014, 200-year-old Citi launched a public virtual accelerator called Citi Mobile Challenge and invited outside developers to solve financial problems with its production APIs and test data. With pressure from consumers to match the convenient services being offered by agile fintech startups, such as mobile apps and fingerprint touch ID, Citi is restructuring its operating model and empowering developer ecosystems to innovate as quickly as a startup, while maintaining its core business. For this reason, it’s not surprising that a month after GE Digital was announced, Citi launched a mobile-centric division called Citi FinTech.</p><p>What’s great about APIs is they don’t require an understanding of how the system on the other side actually functions, allowing business users to self-serve. As a result, APIs are igniting a cultural movement that shifts IT away from delivering narrow projects to the business, and toward delivering reusable capabilities that enable business users to deliver their own projects in their own way.</p><p>APIs and connectivity are becoming the de facto way for IT to provide quick access to data and assets. These APIs can be packaged in a way to make them consumable by many different business units, allowing them to self-serve data and capabilities as needed. It enables a broader audience of business users to access the things they need for analytics, applications and process automation. This philosophical shift away from IT as a technology provider to a strategic business enabler is key for any organization looking to match the speed and agility required in today’s economy.</p><p>After all, today’s modern-day Renaissance is being fueled by binary code instead of literature, APIs instead of paint brushes and operating models instead of political structures. It’s time for organizations to rethink what success looks like and how they can get started with their own digital and cultural transformations.</p>",

The company released Samsung Rewards today, which is a program that provides points whenever a user uses their Samsung Pay for a transaction. The points gathered through the program can then be exchanged for rewards including gift cards, Samsung products, and more from various U. S. retailers.</p><p>The new program tiers reward levels based on thresholds of transactions, giving users “Silver” status for five payments in a month, which earns double the points. 20 transactions results in a “Gold” status, which delivers triple points, and 30 monthly Pay uses puts a user in the “Platinum” rewards group, where each purchase is worth four times the usual amount in points earned.</p><p>The rewards program also comes with a built-in chance to win instant prizes, which are updated monthly,and Samsung will let people track all of the Rewards-related activity in the Samsung Pay app.</p><p>All of this is clearly about incentivizing use, and that’s something basically anyone operating in the mobile payments space is going to need to do in order to spur faster adoption. A universal reward program that isn’t dependent on participation by any individual merchants or payment network is a smart move, since it puts control over the nature and availability of the rewards program entirely in Samsung’s hands – and Samsung is the stakeholder that has the most to gain from the system working out.</p><p>Samsung Rewards launches this week in the U.

    "content": "<p>An entrepreneur recently asked me “What are SaaS companies ‘going for’ these days?” I said, “Well, it depends on a number of factors, but 5 times annual run-rate revenue is average.” His response was pure disbelief. “What? You have to be kidding me! Last time I checked they were going for 10 times revenue!”</p><p>And so it goes; the opaque, confusing and highly volatile practice of valuing a private SaaS business is frustrating for entrepreneurs and investors alike. Furthermore, the lack of transparency adds a tremendous amount of friction to a capital raise or the sale of a company.</p><p>The reality is, it’s not all that hard to get a quick read on your SaaS company’s valuation. The two most important things to know are: What are public SaaS companies “going for” at the time, and how fast is your business growing relative to its peers. These two things will get you 75 percent of the way to an answer, and three or four other metrics will get you the rest of the way there.</p><p>The average public multiple is easy to get and it should always be updated when getting a read on valuation. Go here to pull the data and get the revenue multiple based on the current year expected revenue. Once you have that, subtract 1.3 to get the current private multiple based on ARR* (annualized run-rate revenue). Private multiples are lower because they are generally riskier and the stock is not easy to sell. If the public multiple were 7.0 times revenue, for example, then the average private multiple would be 5.7 times.</p><p>Building from there, the key company-specific metric is revenue growth rate. But it gets a little tricky here because to get a higher multiple, your company must be growing faster than other similar-sized SaaS companies. It’s easier to grow quickly when a company is small, and so the growth premium varies by company size.</p><p>The chart below shows the average growth rate for different-sized private SaaS companies based on a 2016 survey of 400 companies, and this should be used as your benchmark. If your company is growing faster than average for its size, the business will be worth more than the 5.7 times calculated above; if it’s growing slower, it will be worth less.</p><p>How much of an impact the growth rate has on valuation can be estimated based on public SaaS company values. A rule of thumb would be if your business is growing at twice the average rate, the valuation multiple would grow by 50 percent. For example, a $3.0 million SaaS company growing at 100 percent (twice the rate of its peers) would get a growth premium of 2.8 (50 percent of the baseline multiple of 5.7), making it worth about 8.5 times revenue, or $26 million. Similarly, a $60 million SaaS business growing at 50 percent is also growing twice as fast as its peers, and would also garner a similar growth premium.</p><p>There are four other metrics that will impact a company’s value beyond the current state of the public market and its growth rate. They are:</p><p>Do better than “average” on these factors and the valuation multiple will go up; do worse, and it will go down. The chart below can be used to estimate the overall impact of each factor.</p><p>The fact of the matter is, SaaS companies, on average, were never “going for 10 times revenue,” only a few outliers were. The reality is a little less sexy, but still very healthy, and knowing where your business stands based on real-world data will give you an advantage in negotiating the best possible outcome for your company.</p><p>* Based on an analysis of hundreds of private company exit multiples tracked by the 451 Group over 2014, 2015 and 2016, and compared to the public SaaS valuation data at the time.</p>",

S.-India Business Council’s 41st Annual Leadership Summit in Washington D.C., where Bezos and other business leaders met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p><p>This brings the total amount Amazon has invested in Amazon India, which it launched in 2013, to $5 billion. It announced a $2 billion funding back in July 2014.</p><p>In a press release from the U. S.-India Business Council, Bezos said Amazon “has already created some 45,000 jobs in India and continue[s] to see huge potential in the Indian economy.”</p><p>India’s e-commerce market is now the fastest-growing in the world and is expected to be worth $119 billion by 2020, according to Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Amazon India’s main rivals are marketplaces Flipkart and Snapdeal, both of which have significant venture capital banking. According to CrunchBase, Flipkart has raised $3.15 billion so far from investors including Naspers, Tiger Global, DST Global, and Accel; Snapdeal has received about $1.54 billion from backers such as Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, SoftBank, and eBay.</p><p>A February report by Morgan Stanley said that Flipkart was the leader by gross merchandise volume (GMV), with 45 percent market share in 2015. Snapdeal came in second with 26 percent, and Amazon India took third place with 12 percent.</p><p>Both Flipkart and Amazon India, however, have claimed to be the largest e-commerce marketplace in India by user traffic. At the end of last year, comScore released data showing that Amazon India had more than 30 million unique visitors to its site during Diwali holiday sales in October, which Bezos said made it the most visited e-commerce site in India.</p><p>Flipkart then responded with data that claimed its main marketplace and clothing site Myntra (which Flipkart acquired in 2014) received 63 percent of total mobile commerce traffic in December, compared to 15.86 percent for Amazon India, and 13.84 percent for Snapdeal.</p><p>But Flipkart is now facing questions about its GMV growth and ability to continue competing with Amazon India. Morgan Stanley, an investor in Flipkart, recently cut the marketplace’s value to $9.4 billion, down from the $15.2 billion valuation it claimed last year after a $700 million funding round.</p><p>The heated competition comes at a high cost for all of India’s largest e-commerce players.

That puts us in a priviliged position to run analytics on data.”</p><p>The critical system that Skyport monitors is Microsoft’s Active Directory tools for account management and provisioning. According to Gililand, roughly 95% of companies use Active Directory and for those companies that also use Skyport, they can now get a window into how exactly different accounts may be abusing their Active Directory access.</p><p>In most hacks, Active Directory servers aren’t attacked directly, they’re accessed after a network has been breached, but the software is critical to an attackers ability to move freely inside a corporate network, Gililand said. “One of the things we’re able to identify is that somebody is using a credential to create other permissions,” Gililand says.</p><p>While Gililand’s technology can’t ultimately get any hackers off of a network or prevent files from being exfiltrated themselves, they can identify what bad actors may be doing on a network and give a company’s security staff a chance to respond.</p><p>To date, Skyport has raised roughly $67 million from investors including Cisco Investments, GV, Index Ventures, InstantScale Ventures, Intel Capital, Northgate Capital, Sutter Hill ventures, and Thomvest Ventures.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Instagram is adding three new features to Stories in what they are calling the biggest update to Stories since its launch.</p><p>Starting today the company will let creators add URL links to their stories that viewers can navigate to without leaving Instagram, add the ability for users to be “@ mentioned” in someone’s story, and add the ability to add a Boomerang to your story without having to go create one in the separate Boomerang app.</p><p>First and most importantly, Instagram will now let creators add navigable URL links to their stories – meaning viewers can tap a button and instantly be taken to whatever website the creator wants to send them to.</p><p>When tapped, this button will open up a browser within Instagram that automatically navigates to whatever website or page the creator has specified.</p><p>Creators will add a link at the same time they are creating the Story – after capturing a video or picture there will be a button to add the link – just like there are already buttons to add text or a drawing to a Story.</p><p>But Instead of actually showing the URL (which could have created a cluttered experience), Instagram will add a “See More” button to the bottom of any story that has a link added to it. This will keep the photo itself free of ugly links, while still letting users navigate to the link with just one click.</p><p>While this does mean users won’t actually see the link they are going to before they click it, Instagram will be blocking inappropriate links, just like they already do with links in profiles.</p><p>At launch this feature will only be available to verified Instagram accounts. While there’s a chance it may eventually expand all users, Instagram currently won’t say if or when this will ever happen.</p><p>Expect to see this tool used by professional creators who want to direct users to consume content they have created on other platforms, like a video on YouTube or song on SoundCloud. Or celebrities and retailers using Links to direct users to purchase something on an e-commerce site. You’ll also probably see media properties use Links to direct users to read articles on their own website.</p><p>The addition of Links is sure to satisfy brands who want to promote products, and creators who need to promote their others social channels.</p><p>One of the biggest gripes with Snapchat is that creators can’t add links to their Snaps and Stories, meaning their viewers are stuck inside the Snapchat ecosystem. This makes it extremely hard for creators (and brands) to monetize. Creators may now be more inclined to start using Instagram Stories over Snapchat Stories, since they can link viewers out to their own sites.</p><p>Plus, it allows Instagram to sidestep the issue of not allowing links inside actual Instagram pictures in the feed, which is something brands and creators have long complained about. Currently only ads can contain links to websites in the Instagram feed.</p><p>The second feature Instagram is adding to Stories today is Mentions. The feature will let creators use @ to “tag” any other Instagram user in their story.</p><p>After taking a picture or video for a story users can tap to add text, and instead of typing a message they just type @, followed by someone’s Instagram username. And just like in comments and captions, Instagram will autocomplete their username.</p><p>Once “tagged”, the username will be underlined and tappable in the story. When tapped, the tag will take users to the profile of whoever is tagged in the picture. And also like comments and captions, users will receive a notification if they are tagged in the story of someone they follow. If they are tagged in a story by someone they don’t follow, it will show up in their “requests” folder.</p><p>You will able to tag up to 10 people in one Story. But remember that you’ll have to actually add everyone’s username in a text box, which could mean that lots of usernames will clutter up your picture or video.</p><p>Unlike Links, Mentions will be available to all users.</p><p>The last feature is that Instagram is adding Boomerang, its stand-alone app that creates one-second video loops, to Instagram Stories. So when you go to create a new story you can just swipe from “normal” (which lets you capture photos or videos) to Boomerang mode, and capture a Boomerang. Previously users had to leave Instagram Stories and navigate to Boomerang’s stand-alone app.</p><p>Interestingly, Instagram is only adding the ability to create Boomerangs to Stories, and not regular Instagram. This means if you want to add a Boomerang to your Instagram feed you’ll still need to use their separate app.</p><p>These features launch today, and besides Links (which is now only available to verified users) you can start playing with them today.</p>",

DroneBase’s new Pilot Program lets drone owners find gigs nearby where they can fly 10-minute missions, upload the assets, and get paid if a DroneBase clients wants to buy the info.</p><p>By connecting idle pilots with needy businesses, DroneBase can change flying an unmanned aerial vehicle from a hobby into a profession, equip businesses with aerial data without them having to own drones, and build its business too.</p><p>Clients now include construction companies, Hilton hotels, Allstate insurance, Zillow, commercial real estate giants CBRE and JLL, and Keller Williams, the largest realtor by number of agents. They use DroneBase to track progress at their work sites, measure areas and resources, verify insurance claims on roofs, shoot aerial marketing footage of properties, and more. Clients just input their needs, and DroneBase dispatches a pilot with all the skills and hardware necessary to get the job done.</p><p>Dan Burton, DroneBase’s founder and CEO, tells me it’s been “really rewarding” to pay some pilots as much as $50,000 a year. Meanwhile, DroneBase is on track to boost its revenue 700% from 2015 to 2016.</p><p>The potential to crowdsource the future of enterprise drone usage has attracted a $3 million Series A for DroneBase. Previous investor Union Square Ventures and its top dog Fred Wilson led the round. Burton says, “Every interaction with them, they just increase our trust, even when they’re telling us something hard to hear.”</p><p>The round, which brings DroneBase to just over $5 million in funding, was joined by Upfront Ventures, Accel Partners, and DJI. Also based in the startup’s hometown, Burton says Upfront’s access to talent in Los Angeles has been a big help.</p><p>DJI has become DroneBase’s most important partner. DroneBase requires pilots to exclusively use the Chinese manufacturer’s hardware in order to standardize the footage collected. “All the jobs we’ve done, we’ve done every single one on a DJI drone” Burton says. “It removes hardware as a variable.” For example, DroneBase did monthly check-ups on 40 construction sites across the country for one company, and the reports from Arizona and Florida are directly comparable.</p><p>The funding will fuel DroneBase’s invasion of new verticals. When it started in 2014, DroneBase focused on collecting beautiful shots from the sky for real estate marketers. It’s grown into insurance, construction, and mining. Now it wants to advance its business with solar companies and telecom infrastructure owners. ”</p><p>“We’re actively flying in all 50 US states and 30 countries” Burton beams. “Any address in the United States, we can get you drone imagery and data in 48 hours, for almost always under $500.”</p><p>Wait time and prices could drop even further now that civilians can join DroneBase’s Pilot Program. “80% of people who buy a drone, they go out and fly it three or four times, and then it’s collecting cobwebs in their garage” Burton says. Better to put them to use.</p><p>DroneBase has over a million properties it believes would benefit from drone footage. Burton thinks it can sell their owners deeper data for much cheaper than what it would cost to buy a drone and hire a pilot, get helicopter or satellite imagery, or precariously dangle a human from a ladder or harness.</p><p>DroneBase will have to hope regulation keeps it easy for licensed pilots to fly these quick missions. Plus, plenty of other startups want to be DroneBnB too. There’s are legitimate competitors like Skycatch, as well as lots of drone-for-hire sites like Air-Vid, Droners.io, and HireAUAVPro. Still, DroneBase’s biggest foe remains the status quo of not having aerial footage or data at all.</p><p>But as big businesses realize the high value of drones and the high costs of ownership and operation, more will look to pilot marketplaces like DroneBase. “The obsolescence is ridiculous” Burton concludes. “You spend $100,000 on a fleet of drones and it will be obsolete in 6 months.” Why buy the drone when you can get the flights for cheap?</p>",

In parallel, other startups – like Pandorabots, the soon-to-be-announced Automat and my own company, Prompt – are focused on building the picks and shovels for bot developers.</p><p>Some of the top investors in Silicon Valley are placing their bets. Phil Libin at General Catalyst has described bots as “the most important tech trend of the year” and Albert Wenger at Union Square Ventures described this new era as “the Great Bot Rush” (a notably more attractive phrase than “The Botageddon”). Just a few days ago, John Lilly at Greylock tweeted that the “% of pitches for bots and/or AI companies is approaching 100%.” Forward-thinking early stage investors – such as Boris Wertz, Dave Morin, Semil Shah, and Nir Eyal – are also taking a keen interest.</p><p>Bots Are The New Apps</p><p>A Messenger Bot Store would have far-reaching consequences not only for entrepreneurs and investors, but also developers and designers. Sam Lessin, the CEO of Fin, says the rise of chat-based user interfaces will mark “a fundamental shift that is going to change the types of applications that get developed and the style of service development.”</p><p>Chris Messina famously predicted 2016 would be “the year of conversational commerce”, but the Messenger bot platform will inevitably extend far beyond commerce.</p><p>Messaging will become the command line interface for the real world – though it will differ from the command line we’re all familiar with. Given recent advances in natural language processing, the syntax for engaging with bots will be less brittle than the command line of recent decades, even if we are “50 Nobel Prizes away” from HAL 9000 as Benedict Evans astutely observes.</p><p>For a time, bots were perceived to be plain-text exchanges and as such were often described as “invisible apps”. As Jonathan Libov at USV points out, though, “just because the container is a messenger doesn’t mean that all the apps inside are text-based.” Tomaž Štolfa says there is “unexplored potential in blending conversational interfaces with rich graphical UI elements.”</p><p>If 800 million Facebook users start discovering bots in Messenger after F8, it will vindicate those who have been saying bots are the new apps.</p><p>There’s an entire ecosystem, akin to the App Store in its scale, to be built. When you can quickly and easily interact with Dominos, United Airlines and Capital One on Messenger, and will you ever use their bloated native apps again? The current bot landscape feels a lot like the web in 1995, or mobile apps in 2008.</p><p>Many answered questions remain: How long until other messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp, open their platforms to developers too? Will the likes of OpenTable build bots for every messaging platform, or will cross-platform standards for bot development emerge? And perhaps most importantly, for which use cases can messaging deliver a far superior experience to traditional native apps?</p><p>It is true that, as Jonathan Libov has observed, “developer interest in messaging/bots has far, far outpaced consumer interest thus far”.</p><p>But if Ted Livingston’s prediction is correct, then that will all change at F8 on April 12th. In the race to become the WeChat of the West, don’t bet against Facebook Messenger just yet.</p>",

The Balldur (whatever that means) feels like an artifact from a Terry Gilliam movie—and that my friends is a good thing. In some ways, it is also reminiscent of boutique guitar amplifiers. In short, it is nice looking.</p><p>The Kickstarter campaign behind it claims it “has so many functions is [sic] such a small device.” It’s true, it does. It’s on the brink of almost having too many to get a little confusing, but in the end, I think the beautiful design of this solid-looking device wins the day.</p><p>And while little messaging flubs like showing a non-qi compatible device like an iPhone wirelessly charging on it are sure to irritate the card-carrying nerds among us (myself included), I’d still probably sign up for something like this.</p><p>In terms of the functionality (outside of letting there be light) the Balldur lists:</p><p>So, as you can see, there are many things this doodad can do for you.

The wireless charging and find-your-phone add-ons are nice-to-haves.</p><p>In this age of cognitive devices and approaches like Amazon Echo or the Staples Easy System, the Balldur is sort of the anti-echo…not a sleek, cylindrical column of the future but instead sort of a reminder of the past while having present, needed functions and that’s OK.

    "content": "<p>Kill SMS, spawn a chat bot platform, bring friends together offline, improve artificial intelligence, and delight people. That’s Facebook Messenger’s roadmap for 2016 now that it has 800 million monthly active users, up from 700 million in June, 600 Million in March, and 500 million last November.</p><p>That makes Messenger the fastest growing app of 2015, according to Nielsen, and it was the second most popular iOS app behind Facebook. It’s also transmitting 10 billion photos per month.</p><p>Now that Facebook’s chat app is reaching ubiquity in some markets, it can start putting the nail in the coffin of competitors, entrenching itself with a developer ecosystem, and going beyond the mandate of traditional messaging.</p><p>In a blog post today, head of Messenger David Marcus laid out the main themes of Facebook’s 2016 strategy. Yesterday I spoke with Stan Chudnovsky, Messenger’s head of product, to get a deeper look at the plan. Below is a breakdown of the strategy, plus my predictions for how Messenger will execute it.</p><p>First, a quick rundown of what Messenger accomplished in 2015:</p><p>Messenger is so far ahead of other core messaging apps in the U. S. (sorry Google) that now its only worthy competitor is SMS/iMessage. Marcus says SMS was born out of the flip phone era and now we need chat for the smartphone era. By building in rich media features like photos, stickers, GIFs, payments, apps, location, and transportation, Messenger has tried to convince people to ditch SMS, which does none of those gracefully.</p><p>Messenger now lets anyone send a message request to anyone on Facebook, effectively eliminating the need to know someone’s phone number. Chudnovsky tells me “We have the directory of everyone that is out there, we can allow you to find anyone you want and all you need is a name.” Putting essentially every Internet-connected human on one open communication system is a huge leap forward</p><p>Video has become the hit of mobile, yet video calling is still clumsy. Skype sucks and FaceTime only works on iPhones. Messenger already has VoIP audio and video calling, but many users don’t know about it or rely on it. I’d expect Messenger to launch group video calling to differentiate itself, and use the fun experience of being on the line with several friends to convince users SMS is obsolete.</p><p>Messenger wants you to be able to do many of the most common things you do on your phone straight from its chat threads. Chat is the center of mobile, the way search was the center of the web. Now Facebook wants to harness that attention to build a portal to commerce, content, and more.</p><p>Marcus writes that Messenger is devising new ways to “interact with businesses or services to buy items (and then buy more again), order rides, purchase airline tickets, and talk to customer service in truly frictionless and delightful ways.”</p><p>Facebook wants to allow businesses to operate on mobile without maintaining an app by combining Facebook Pages with the ability to do customer service over Messenger. Since almost every business needs to communicate with customers, Facebook could provide an essential service for free or cheap to pull businesses onto Messenger. Right now the customer service system is still in early testing, but I’d bet Facebook starts formalizing a system for translating those endless touchtone phone menus into message threads.</p><p>If Messenger can be where you talk with your closest friends, which you’ll do very frequently, it can use that gravity to pull in other types of conversations. Facebook will continue adding ways to customize your threads with more feeling, similar to WhatsApp, which Marcus describes as “your very own social handshake.” It wants to feel like your digital third space — Not home, not work, but where you can express and relax.</p><p>Facebook knows who all of your friends are, knows when they’re online, and it’s where you already go when you’re bored. I expect Facebook will launch a product continuing the mission of Nearby Friends that will focus on helping you discover which friends in your city are available to meet up offline.</p><p>In 2015, Google tried to gain traction with “Who’s Down” and Danny Trinh’s startup launched Free, both of which try to find you friends to hang out with. Neither took off. Because they lack ubiquity of installation and engagement, they’re much worse equipped to solve the problem than Facebook.</p><p>Facebook wants to differentiate Messenger from all the other ways to text message. Thanks to its financial and engineering resources, it’s built the personal assistant M. While M’s combination of human and artificial intelligence will be slow and expensive to roll out, it will teach Facebook about what people could want out of Messenger beyond messaging, and help it understand natural language. That could tie into more voice-based interfaces for Messenger, where it could transcribe dictation or read you messages aloud.</p><p>Rather than trying to build all the functionality users could want into chat threads itself, Facebook will launch a platform for building bots and interactive experiences on Messenger. M will serve as a flagship, best-in-class example. This week I broke the news that Facebook has secretly given some developers access to a new Chat SDK that lets them build bots that can automatically respond to text messages, and hook into Messenger’s payments system. Getting outside developers to build experiences for Messenger, the app will make it more sticky, and open opportunities for monetization.</p><p>Facebook finally started to embrace a more whimsical approach with Messenger this year. You could make hearts or snow rain down on chat threads with the right emoji. These little design flourishes remind people they’re using a messaging platform with more humanity than cold, robotic SMS.</p><p>Prediction: How Facebook Will Keep Teens</p><p>Facebook has always grappled with worries that it would become uncool. But now that the focus of its product is starting to shift from its social network to it</p>",

    "content": "<p>In March of last year, our GV engineering team analyzed market data to assess whether or not the tech industry was experiencing a bubble.</p><p>That question was being asked a lot at the time (it’s less prevalent now, in light of some changes in the market). During our research, we uncovered ample evidence to argue both sides of the coin. And even with a great deal of number crunching, we didn’t arrive at a definitive answer.</p><p>The most we could verify is that if we were in a bubble, it was a very different bubble from the heady dotcom days in 2000. One important difference is that in 2000, individual investors in public equities bore the brunt of the dotcom bubble burst. If there’s a bubble today, private capital investors and institutions likely stand to lose the most. That includes GV.</p><p>Have things changed? More than a year later, our engineering team has repeated the exercise, looking at data from a variety of sources to answer this persistent question of whether or not we’re in a bubble. The evidence still doesn’t point to a definitive answer. Here’s what we found:</p><p>Fewer deals. Entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley talk anecdotally about a funding slowdown.  Sure enough, the data show that venture capital dollars deployed in Q1 are down 11%, and the number of deals dropped 5% compared with last year.</p><p>Fewer IPOs. As we’ve all seen, companies are waiting longer to go public. The first quarter of 2016 was the slowest for IPOs since 2011, and the average time between first funding and IPO is now eight years.</p><p>Dropping Valuations. Later stage companies that may be contemplating IPO have seen their valuations start to fall.  We’ve seen data that suggest late-stage valuations as a whole have dropped more than 43% since their peak at third quarter of last year.</p><p>Ample venture capital. Venture capital funds raised $13B in the first three months of 2016, the largest quarter  and a full 59% higher than the same period last year.   And it’s worth noting that the National Venture Capital Association reports that the VC industry deployed more capital in 2015 than any year since 1995.</p><p>Sustained late-stage deals.   Despite the valuation decline, later stage companies continue to raise additional rounds at an enthusiastic pace. In Q1 2016, investments in later stage rounds increased 10%, representing 22% of the total deal volume.</p><p>Profitable M&A Exits. The IPO slowdown isn’t necessarily a bad thing, either.  In the first quarter of this year, there were 25% fewer M&A exits quarter over quarter, but the deal value was double year over year.  Exits through acquisitions seem to have taken the place of some IPOs.  The Microsoft / LinkedIn news underscores the M&A environment in the public markets.</p><p>So… is there a bubble?  What is a reasonable conclusion from this less-than-conclusive data?  Data more often lead to solid conclusions rather than predictions, which is what makes this difficult.</p><p>I think a bubble that suddenly goes “pop” is less likely given the data from the last few quarters, but caution is still warranted. It’s on my mind as I review potential investments. Like most venture investors, the companies we invest in stand a chance of failing, and unbridled success is rare. Spectacular failures, while unfortunate, are part of our reality.</p><p>Regardless of the economic climate, the real job of any investor is to help entrepreneurs build meaningful companies and technologies. The best investors that we know don’t try to time the market, and neither do the best entrepreneurs. We have to keep at it.</p>",

It said it would be awarding a series of grants of between $25k and $50k to bot developers throughout this year.</p><p>In the event, it’s taken nearly seven month for the first batch of five winners to be announced — whose developers are collectively taking home around a quarter ($200k+) of the prize fund.</p><p>It says it will continue awarding bot makers “this and next year” in $200,000 batches, but had previously said the entire $1M fund would be distributed by December 31 — so it’s possible it’s taking a little longer than expected for quality bots to arise and/or make a mark with users.</p><p>“Selecting the right bots was a challenge, and this time we focused mainly on the bots already demonstrating organic growth,” said Telegram founder, Pavel Durov, when we asked how hard it’s been for the company to find the fast and useful bots it’s looking for.</p><p>Here’s the winner list — which includes a bot that will stylize your selfies, a game bot designed for group chats and a money transfer bot:</p><p>@icon8bot – an AI-based bot for applying filters to photos using neural networks and machine learning tech</p><p>@integram_bot – a bot that supports setting up integrations with third-party services for developers such us Trello, Gitlab and Bitbucket</p><p>@werewolfbot – a ‘Werewolf Game’ bot for group chats which Telegram says has been popular in SE Asia</p><p>@strangerbot – a bot that connects two random users to chat anonymously which Telegram claims “gained huge popularity after going viral in Southern Europe”</p><p>@octopocket_bot – a smart-wallet bot that allows users from the EU to transfer money to each other and is integrated into the ATM system of Spain</p><p>The first five Telegram bot winners span five very different categories so there’s no usage trend conclusions to be drawn. Durov also did not respond to a request for latest usage metrics for bots on the Telegram platform so it’s not yet clear how popular the automated accounts are proving.</p><p>In a blog announcing the first BotPrize winners Telegram says its hopes is the prize money will be used for “further development and scaling of these great bots”.</p><p>Durov has previously said Telegram will launch a payments mechanism for bots this year — holding out the prospect for bot devs on the platform being able to monetize their creations in the near term, assuming they can attract and drive usage.</p><p>Telegram itself announced passing 100 million monthly active users in February this year, when it also said it was adding 350,000 new users each day.</p><p>The lasting utility of bots outside Chinese messaging app giant and bot pioneer WeChat’s walls remains to be proven. Plenty of US tech platforms are trying to repeat this playbook by launching their own bot platforms (e.g. Facebook). But it’s far from clear whether web users outside the Great Firewall of China have as much appetite for relying on a single ‘super platform’ laden with third party bot-powered services to do everything for them.</p><p>It’s certainly a very different ethos to ‘an app for everything’, which ruled the first wave of the modern smartphone ecosystem. But while the jury is out on bots’ place and role in the wider digital business world, the experiment continues.</p><p>Last month, for example, Telegram launched a bot-powered gaming platform — with avisually appealing games that live inside chats on its platform. While earlier this month it emerged Facebook is testing a similar offering called ‘Instant Games’ inside its messaging app, Messenger.</p>",

GE Ventures had been an investor in the company as part of the $82 million Series F round in 2015.</p><p>The two companies have more in common than you might think. GE is building the Predix Platform, on top of which it hopes companies will build applications that take advantage of sensor data coming off of Internet of Things-connected devices. GE has made a huge bet on the Industrial Internet of Things, using data on huge machines like MRI machines, wind turbines and airplane engines to give customers the data they need to proactively maintain these mega systems.</p><p>In fact, when I spoke to Athani Krishnaprasad, co-founder and chief innovation officer at ServiceMax recently, we talked about a future vision where sensors on IoT devices fed information to companies, allowing them to build entirely new business models. In Krishnaprasad’s vision for his company, a hospital would subscribe to an MRI machine instead of buying it and pay for guaranteed up time instead of the physical hardware.</p><p>It would be up to the vendor to proactively monitor the device and keep it up and running. Data coming from sensors would let the company know when a part was about to break or that it was time for regular maintenance. He called this “outcome-based services.”</p><p>“Analyzing the data to change business process to gain efficiencies or service customers better is a big win,” Krishnaprasad explained.</p><p>And as GE transforms from a company simply selling those big machines to one that fits so well with ServiceMax’s future world view, the two companies coming together makes so much sense.</p><p>“This acquisition builds upon our ongoing efforts to enhance our overall technology stack around the Predix platform and advance our Industrial Internet vision,” Bill Ruh, GE Digital CEO said in a statement. “Improved productivity is critical for the Industrial Internet and digitizing field services is a cornerstone of a successful digital industrial strategy,” he added.</p><p>ServiceMax CEO Dave Yarnold says this move gives his company resources he couldn’t imagine, and he still gets to run it as a separate entity within the larger organization. “Bill [Ruh] wants to run this as a separate business and really invest it. We want to build an operating system for the service economy. To be able to accelerate that and work with one of the best companies in the world and increase investment in the marketing and the product, it allows us to accelerate that vision — and I’m excited about taking that forward.</p><p>ServiceMax has raised over $200 million since it was founded in 2007.

Somewhat like Facebook at Work’s version of Messenger, the new “Work Chat” app, as it’s called, allows coworkers to message each other individually, participate in group chats, share photos and videos, make voice calls, and even use stickers.</p><p>The application quietly debuted on the Google Play store on Thursday. Facebook tells us the iOS version is in the works, and will arrive soon. However, the company would not provide an exact launch date.</p><p>The new chat app arrives just ahead of the planned public debut of a freemium version of the business networking platform, which Facebook said this fall was expected to arrive before year-end. That date may actually be closer to “in the next year,” Facebook says today.</p><p>The Facebook at Work program has been in private testing since its unveiling this January, and now has hundreds of companies on board. In fact, Facebook tells us that it has 300 businesses using its platform as of today, ranging from smaller startups to large, established companies like banks, real estate firms, beverage companies, travel companies, and more.</p><p>These customers include several big names like Heineken USA, Hootsuite, Linio in Latin America, and, in one of its largest deals, the Royal Bank of Scotland, which plans to have 30,000 workers on Facebook at Work by March 2016, and then its entire workforce of 100,000 by the end of next year.</p><p>The enterprise version of Facebook looks a lot like the consumer version of Facebook, and includes its own website as well as Facebook at Work mobile applications for iOS and Android. Employers can set up new accounts for their staff to use on the platform, and users can choose to link their personal and work accounts together. The service also allows for other business use cases, like document sharing, discussions, announcements, groups, project collaborations, events, and more.</p><p>As a freemium service, Facebook at Work will soon compete head-to-head with a number of other social and communication-focused platforms for businesses, including Microsoft’s Yammer, Salesforce Chatter, and the rapidly growing Slack. It could eventually take on other platforms businesses use to communicate and organize information for employees, including the old standby SharePoint, for example.</p><p>But Slack could be one of Facebook for Work’s bigger challengers, given its emphasis on making work feel fun and social – which is the same vibe that Facebook is going after, as well. And Slack’s communication platform is more robust than Messenger (or Work Chat, as it’s called here) in many ways, given its growing number of integration partners, like Lyft, Foursquare, Dribble, Dropbox, Giphy, Google Drive, IFTTT, Twitter, Box, Google Calendar, Heroku, MailChimp, New Relic, Stripe, Trello, Visual Studio, Zendesk, and many others.</p><p>Slack has also been rapidly adding enterprise-focused features, like the ability to add new employees automatically to a preset list of channels when they log on for the first time, or the ability to map user groups to Active Directory via SSO providers. The company says now that it has 1.7 million users logging in daily.</p><p>Given Facebook at Work’s similarity to Facebook proper, it’s not surprising to see that Facebook has now rolled out a dedicated chat client for its enterprise user base. The client itself is not all that remarkable, given that it’s basically just Messenger for use with your co-workers. However, it does have a nice feature that allows you to disable your notifications when you don’t want to be disturbed or when you’re on vacation – something that could help provided better work/life balance for employees.</p><p>Work Chat is live now on the Google Play store, but is only available to use by those who are currently testing the Facebook at Work service.</p>",

Of that figure, 75 percent of revenue came from mobile devices — RMB 17.5 billion (US$2.6 billion) — which is up 119 percent year-over-year.</p><p>Mobile revenue outstripped desktop for Alibaba’s Chinese marketplaces last year, but now the scale has finally tipped to mobile across its entire business with average spend higher from users on mobile than those accessing Alibaba via a PC. Handling the switch to mobile was a critical concern for investors prior to the IPO, and Alibaba executives admitted that the speed of this shift has surprised even them.</p><p>While revenue growth was undoubtedly the highlight for Alibaba executives, the company’s net income dropped 76 percent year-on-year to RMB 7,142 million, $1.1 billion, thanks to a one-off gain from its Alibaba Pictures affiliate last year. Other metrics were impressive with non-GAAP net income up 28 percent over the same period, and operating profit rising by 71 percent.</p><p>Outside of its core business, cloud computing is an area where Alibaba has been piling resources. Its Alicloud business more than doubled its revenue year-on-year to reach RMB 1.2 billion, or around $181 million, for the quarter with 577,000 paying customers.</p><p>That business is still a work in progress, though. Alicloud carded an improved RMB 439 million ($66 million) operating loss for the quarter and, speaking on an analyst call, Alibaba Vice President Joe Tsai said it is “moving towards breakeven.”</p><p>Alibaba has come under fire for not making its financial data clear enough, with the SEC investigating its accounting of affiliates like logistics firm Cainao, online-to-offline platform Koubei, video platform Youku Tudou, and Ant Financial.</p><p>In response, Alibaba broke out increased financial data — including revenue and profit/loss — for business units like such as digital media, cloud computing, food delivery and more for the first time.</p><p>For now, those affiliates are burning cash — per the chart below — but Alibaba is betting that they will supplement its core business in the future.</p><p>Alibaba is making another major bet on emerging markets.</p><p>It took a majority stake in Lazada, a Rocket Internet-backed e-commerce site in Southeast Asia, for $1 billion earlier this year, and in India it has backed mobile wallet-commerce company Paytm, as well as e-commerce unicorn Snapdeal.</p><p>“We’re starting to serve local consumers in Southeast Asia, a market with over 500 million potential consumers,” Tsai said. “That’s going to be a very important potential market for us.”</p><p>“We’ve decided to place some very strategic assets” in India, he added. “We think mobile and payments are going to be an important strategy for us there.”</p><p>Article updated to include further information about net income and Alibaba’s desktop/mobile revenue rates.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Chinese Internet giant Tencent is getting its tentacles into India’s healthcare space after it led a $90 million Series C round for medical search startup Practo. The startup raised $30 million in February, and it confirmed that Google Capital, Yuri Milner, Sofina, Altimeter and existing investors Sequoia and Matrix took part in the new raise.</p><p>Bangalore-based Practo has a two-sided business model which consists of a marketplace/search portal that connects patients with doctors and medical organizations, while it offers practice management software — Practo Ray — that helps it build relationships with the latter. The company claims to have 200,000 doctors, 8,000 hospitals and 5,000 diagnostic centers across 35 cities in India on its platform. It has expanded into Singapore and Manila, Philippines, where it said it has 80 percent of doctors from both cities on its search service.</p><p>Following its Series B earlier this year, Practo founder and CEO Shashank ND told TechCrunch that the company had aggressive plans to expand its presence both inside India and overseas into new regions. That remains the case, albeit this fresh injection of capital will expedite those growth plans further still.</p><p>Confirming that this new round originated from inbound interest from investors, Shashank said Practo is close to launching officially in six new countries. The company is aiming to be in 100 cities in India and 10 international markets across Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe by March of next year.</p><p>“We have no CFO right now,” he said. “[Because] as a company we are only focused on the vision. We saw like-minded investors reach out proactively, and when our plans match their plans, we look at what is possible.</p><p>“We’re not involved in any asset heavy models, hence all the capital that we are raising will go into building more quality products and expanding geographical impact.”</p><p>On that note, Practo has plans to add wellness and fitness to its portal, which claims 10 million monthly searches, and introduce search options for users wanting to connect with pharmacies and diagnostic labs for reports.</p><p>The strain of India’s billion-plus population and the issue of scant healthcare resources in rural areas are issues being tackled by startups that have latched on to the growth of smartphones and mobile Internet as distribution platforms (rival Lybrate landed $10.2 million led by Tiger Global in July). But Shashank told TechCrunch that he believes there is potential to go way beyond India.</p><p>“We’re very excited about Asia producing a great platform; health is one area where a platform is missing [worldwide],” he said. “I’m very proud that, with the work we have done, we can say that we will be able to scale this business to build that elusive global health platform. We’re very proud that it will come out of Asia.”</p><p>Despite international ambition, Practo has work to do in India. The company has been on an acquisition spree of late, picking up fitness app Fitho in April and e-commerce startup Genli in July. Shashank said the deals will continue to flow thick and fast in order to” bring on great people… and develop our product portfolio and consolidate our space.” The company expects to double its 1,500 team over the next year through acquisitions and hiring.</p><p>The addition of Tencent as an investor is interesting, since the company has made few moves in India to date. Beyond providing capital to grow the business, Practo could benefit from the alliance by tapping into WeChat, Tencent’s blockbuster messaging app that claims over half a billion active users worldwide each month.</p><p>Shashank wouldn’t be drawn on discussing future collaborations, but, with WeChat (known as Weixin in China, where it is the country’s most popular mobile app) pushing local services and online-to-offline features, integrating medical/doctor search and services makes absolute sense.</p><p>That kind of distribution could give Practo a running start as and when it expands into China, but Tencent may also look to use an alliance to grow usage of WeChat in India and parts of Southeast Asia, where it has previously entered into partnerships with Uber rival Easy Taxi.</p><p>Tencent’s investment in Practo is the latest significant deal in India from a major Chinese Internet player. Reports last week suggested Alibaba has finally closed an on-off deal to invest in Indian e-commerce firm Snapdeal. Alibaba’s financial arm, Ant, invested in Indian e-commerce and payments provider Paytm, via parent firm One97, at a reported billion-dollar valuation earlier this year.</p><p>Note: The original version of this post mistakenly valued Practo’s Series B round at $60 million, that has since been corrected. Apologies for any confusion.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Samsung is increasing its focus on the connected car after the Korean firm announced plans to buy auto and audio product maker Harman in an all cash deal worth $8 billion.</p><p>You may best associate the name with audio equipment, but Harman is big on cars, too. The acquisition is Samsung’s largest to date and a big deal for its automotive ambitions. Around 65 percent of Harman’s sales — which totaled $7 billion over the last year — were for car-related products. Samsung added that Harman products, which included connected car devices and audio systems, are installed in an estimated 30 million vehicles worldwide.</p><p>Samsung lags Google and Apple on in-car entertainment and software systems (Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, respectively) so this deal will give it the kind of reach that could allow it to compete more evenly with its rivals inside the car.</p><p>“Harman perfectly complements Samsung in terms of technologies, products and solutions, and joining forces is a natural extension of the automotive strategy we have been pursuing for some time,” Oh-Hyun Kwon, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Samsung Electronics, said in a statement.</p><p>Terms of the deal will see Samsung pay $112.00 per share. That’s a healthy premium on Harman’s current share price of $87.65, and it gives the deal a total value of approximately $8 billion. The transaction is expected to close by mid-2017, at which time Harman will become a standalone subsidiary of Samsung. Dinesh Paliwal will continue to lead the firm as its Chairman, President and CEO, both Harman and Samsung said.</p><p>“Samsung is an ideal partner for Harman and this transaction will provide tremendous benefits to our automotive customers and consumers around the world,” Paliwal added via canned comment.</p><p>With Google rapidly advancing its automotive technology and Apple reportedly developing an electric vehicle (or not), it is perhaps not surprising that Samsung has made ground on automotive itself in 2016.</p><p>This summer, it invested $450 million into China-based electric car maker BYD, which includes Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. among its investor base. Other reports suggested that the Korean giant was also eyeing up a bid for Magneti Marelli, a manufacturing subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler.</p><p>This investment will go beyond automotive, though, according to Samsung. The firm said it plans to marry its own electronics division and expertise with that of Harman for audio — both on the consumer and professional side of business — and connected devices, aka the internet of things, or IOT for short.</p><p>IOT is still very much a buzzword, but Samsung said it plans to utilize Harman’s 8,000 developers to “deliver the next generation of cloud-based consumer and enterprise experiences, as well as end-to-end services for the automotive market through the convergence of design, data and devices.”</p><p>Other notable acquisitions from Samsung of late include Viv, a highly regarded virtual assistant from the creators of Apple’s Siri service, and cloud computing company Joyent.</p>",

    "content": "<p>It’s important for tech companies to have at least one voice at the senior leadership table that advocates for issues around equality, diversity and inclusion. Unfortunately, that’s just not the case for many companies in the tech industry. Salesforce, a company that said a year ago that a major focus for it was “the women’s issue,” recently became an exception to the rule with the hiring of Tony Prophet, its first-ever chief equality officer. Two weeks into his role, Prophet sat down with me to chat about Salesforce’s evolution from a focus on diversity and inclusion to an overall focus on equality.</p><p>“The notion of being chief equality officer — now that was very thoughtful and deliberate on Salesforce’s part and on Marc’s [Benioff] part versus being chief of diversity or chief of inclusion because you can have a diverse workplace or a diverse culture in many parts of America that are very diverse but are hardly inclusive and there’s hardly equality,” Prophet told me. “We want to go beyond diversity and beyond inclusion to really achieve equality.”</p><p>As the company’s first head of equality, Prophet has the flexibility to design parts of his role. Ultimately, he sees himself as being an advocate for issues pertaining to equality, including equal pay, equal advancement, equal opportunity and equal rights, Prophet told me.</p><p>“Equality goes on top of having a diverse workforce and inclusive workforce,” Prophet said. “So [the role] needs to be built on a foundation of making sure we look like the communities in which we operate. We have work to do there, as does the whole tech industry, in ensuring that all feel welcome and their voices heard, and they feel respected and they can bring their authentic selves to work every day, and give their very best.”</p><p>As Prophet noted, Salesforce does have a lot of work to do. Salesforce’s diversity numbers fall in line with the average Silicon Valley tech company, with a workforce that is 70 percent male, 67 percent white, 4 percent hispanic and 2 percent black, according to Salesforce’s August 2015 report.</p><p>As some people have said in the past, efforts around diversity and inclusion need to start at the top. What’s notable about Prophet’s role is that he’s in the C-suite and has the ear of the other CEO, chief executive officer Marc Benioff, which is pretty rare in the realm of diversity and inclusion. Typically, leaders in those roles fall under the human resources department. On average, Prophet is in touch with Benioff once a day and expects to have one-on-one, face-to-face check-ins with him a couple of times a month.</p><p>As the chief of equality, Prophet oversees efforts around diversity and inclusion, so he also has a tight connection with those on the human resources team. Prophet will have his own team, which won’t fully form until February. He says that it won’t be too big in size because he doesn’t think “building a very large team sends the right signals.”</p><p>Tech companies like TaskRabbit are engaged in affirmative action, and that’s ok</p><p>Google opens computer science lab in Oakland for young people of color</p><p>Social justice activism takes center stage at White House's SXSL</p><p>Instead, Prophet’s equality team will partner with some of the people from the system that’s already in place. Salesforce, for example, already has a recruiting program called Future Force that focuses on college campuses.</p><p>“Recruiting is absolutely essential,” Prophet said. “You can’t get into a position of equality if you don’t have a broadly diverse organization.”</p><p>Just like Salesforce is deliberate about the phrasing of the title and role Prophet now holds, Salesforce is also deliberate in the way it refers to its efforts around diversity and inclusion, which it does not refer to as affirmative action.</p><p>“We’re really focused on having a diverse workforce that over time represents the communities where we operate and an inclusive environment and then really striving for real equality in the workplace and in the community,” Prophet said. “That’s really the vocabulary that we’re locking in on, so people are really precise and focused and aren’t connecting it to any things that have past associations that you don’t need to define or explain. With those things in the past, there’s so much baggage and they’re shorthand for things that you can’t unpack what’s in someone’s mind when they hear those words. First thing, we’re about diversity, inclusion and equality.”</p>",

The move places Microsoft’s IDE on Macs. The IDE follows Visual Studio Code, Microsoft’s code editor, to OS X.</p><p>Why is Microsoft seemingly abandoning the quest for Windows hegemony? The writing is on the wall: cloud computing is the future and tools like AWS and Azure are quickly replacing the local server. Microsoft is losing out to tools like Docker and Heroku on the web and it’s only a matter of time before coders are more comfortable with their MacBooks and VIM than with Windows.</p><p>“They make their money off Azure and other services. In other words, they are making their money mainly off of developers now and its in their best interest to get on the good side of devs which is why they suddenly have a vested interest in open sourcing tools and helping Mac/Linux,” wrote Hacker News user BoysenberryPi.</p><p>The IDE is very similar to the one found on Windows. In fact, that is presumably the point. By making it easy for OS X users to switch back and forth between platforms Microsoft is able ensure coders can quickly become desktop agnostic or, barring that, give Windows a try again. From the release:</p><p>￼At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor.</p><p>You can read more about the platform here and prepare yourself for a little C# coding with Visual Studio Code.</p>",

    "content": "<p>China’s Didi Chuxing revealed last month that it plans to expand into global markets, and today we got the first hint of what that might look like after the Uber rival announced a tie-in with U. S. car rental giant Avis.</p><p>The partnership will Avis introduce an option for booking cars overseas — in 175 countries, to be precise — inside the Didi app. The option is strictly for booking cars, not chauffeured cars or taxis. The upshot is that Chinese tourists who are traveling abroad get a fairly convenient way to plan their travel once they land and before they jet off, assuming that they want their own four-wheels.</p><p>TechCrunch understands that the initial integration will go live in early 2017 ahead of Chinese New Year at the end of January. (That makes sense since many Chinese travel overseas for the holiday period.) Further down the line, Didi may increase its integration with Avis to allow users to book cars — and potentially more — on the ground once overseas.</p><p>This isn’t a spectacular, fireworks-filled first push overseas, but it is a move that could play a part in helping Didi to identify countries where its users are particular keen to manage their transportation options, and thus markets where the company could expand its services organically. Yes, Didi does have investments in Uber rivals in the U. S. (Lyft), India (Ola) and Southeast Asia (Grab), but it has said that its global expansion could come in the form of starting its own operations or buying local services. There’s no word on when the global expansion may come, for that matter.</p><p>Perhaps interesting to note, Didi confirmed to us that this “strategic partnership” does not include any investment on either side. Had that not been the case, it might have been telling of Didi’s global plans, but it isn’t.</p>",

Previously, she joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1999 and was also founding CEO of digital media company RMG Networks, backed by KPCB. Follow her on Twitter @aileenlee.</p><p>Many entrepreneurs, and the venture investors who back them, seek to build billion-dollar companies.</p><p>Why do investors seem to care about “billion dollar exits”? Historically, top venture funds have driven returns from their ownership in just a few companies in a given fund of many companies. Plus, traditional venture funds have grown in size, requiring larger “exits” to deliver acceptable returns. For example – to return just the initial capital of a $400 million venture fund, that might mean needing to own 20 percent of two different $1 billion companies, or 20 percent of a $2 billion company when the company is acquired or goes public.</p><p>So, we wondered, as we’re a year into our new fund (which doesn’t need to back billion-dollar companies to succeed, but hey, we like to learn): how likely is it for a startup to achieve a billion-dollar valuation? Is there anything we can learn from the mega hits of the past decade, like Facebook, LinkedIn and Workday?</p><p>To answer these questions, the Cowboy Ventures team built a dataset of U. S.-based tech companies started since January 2003 and most recently valued at $1 billion by private or public markets. We call it our “Learning Project,” and it’s ongoing.</p><p>With big caveats that 1) our data is based on publicly available sources, such as CrunchBase, LinkedIn, and Wikipedia, and 2) it is based on a snapshot in time, which has definite limitations, here is a summary of what we’ve learned, with more explanation following this list*:</p><p>Learnings to date about the “Unicorn Club”:</p><p>We found 39 companies belong to what we call the “Unicorn Club” (by our definition, U. S.-based software companies started since 2003 and valued at over $1 billion by public or private market investors). That’s about .07 percent of venture-backed consumer and enterprise software startups.</p><p>On average, four unicorns were born per year in the past decade, with Facebook being the breakout “super-unicorn” (worth >$100 billion). In each recent decade, 1-3 super unicorns have been born.</p><p>Consumer-oriented unicorns have been more plentiful and created more value in aggregate, even excluding Facebook.</p><p>But enterprise-oriented unicorns have become worth more on average, and raised much less private capital, delivering a higher return on private investment.</p><p>Companies fall somewhat evenly into four major business models: consumer e-commerce, consumer audience, software-as-a-service, and enterprise software.</p><p>It has taken seven-plus years on average before a “liquidity event” for companies, not including the third of our list that is still private. It’s a long journey beyond vesting periods.</p><p>Inexperienced, twentysomething founders were an outlier. Companies with well-educated, thirtysomething co-founders who have history together have built the most successes</p><p>The “big pivot” after starting with a different initial product is an outlier.</p><p>San Francisco (not the Valley) now reigns as the home of unicorns.</p><p>There is very little diversity among founders in the Unicorn Club.</p><p>Figuring out the denominator to unicorn probability is hard. The NVCA says over 16,000 internet-related companies were funded since 2003; Mattermark says 12,291 in the past 2 years; and the CVR says 10-15,000 software companies are seeded each year. So let’s say 60,000 software and internet companies were funded in the past decade. That would mean .07 percent have become unicorns. Or, 1 in every 1,538.</p><p>Takeaway: it’s really hard, and highly unlikely, to build or invest in a billion dollar company. The tech news may make it seem like there’s a winner being born every minute — but the reality is, the odds are somewhere between catching a foul ball at an MLB game and being struck by lightning in one’s lifetime. Or, more than 100x harder than getting into Stanford.</p><p>* That said, these 39 companies have shown it’s possible  – and they do offer a lot that can be learned from.</p><p>Facebook is what we call a super-unicorn: it accounts for almost half of the $260 billion aggregate value of the companies on our list. (As such, we excluded them from analysis related to valuations or capital raised)</p><p>Prior decades have also given birth to tech super-unicorns. The 1990s gave birth to Google, currently worth nearly 3x Facebook; and Amazon, worth ~ $160 billion. The 1980’s: Cisco. The 1970s: Apple (currently the most valuable company in the world), Oracle, and Microsoft; and Intel was founded in the 1960s.</p><p>What do super-unicorns have in common? The 1960s marked the era of the semiconductor; the 1970s, the birth of the personal computer; the 1980s, a new networked world; the 1990s, the dawn of the modern Internet; and in the 2000s, new social networks were built.</p><p>Each major wave of technology innovation has given rise to one or more super-unicorns — companies that could change your life to work at or invest in, if you’re not lucky/genius enough to be a co-founder. This leads to more questions. What is the fundamental technology change of the next decade (mobile?); and will a new super-unicorn or two be born as a result?</p><p>Only four unicorns are born per year on average. But not all years have been as fertile:</p><p>The 38 companies on our list outside of Facebook are worth about $3.6 billion on average. This might feel like a letdown after reading about super-unicorns, but remember, startups generally start as ideas that most people think are crazy, dumb, or not that important (remember when people ridiculed Twitter as the place to share that you were eating a ham sandwich?). Only after many years and extraordinary good fortune, a few grow into unicorns, which is extremely rare and pretty awesome.</p><p>Unicorn foundi</p>",

    "content": "<p>My MacBook Pro is on its last legs. The anti-glare laminate began bubbling up some time ago, spreading across the screen like an untreatable rash, fogging up the webcam in the process. The hinge is loose, so the screen shakes when someone walks by. The little black rubber bumpers have fallen off the bottom and, every so often, there’s an audible buzz of a fan rumbling from under the hood that can only be silenced with a swift smack by the heel of my hand. Also, the battery’s been having issues for a while.</p><p>My 2012 MacBook Pro has been through a lot. It’s traveled the world in a carry-on and survived several Apple live blogs and CESes, attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion and C-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. I’ve promised to put it out to pasture many times over, patiently awaiting the company to offer a truly meaningful refresh of the line, but each year I’ve held out, largely unimpressed by what the company has had to offer as it diverted resources to other product lines.</p><p>Now, finally, the time has come. A full four years after the last major upgrade, the new MacBook Pro is finally here. It’s slimmer and lighter than its predecessor, while maintaining a majority of its iconic aluminum design language. The internals have been souped up, along with the keyboard, touchpad and speakers. There’s a lot to like here.</p><p>The ports have been — well, they’ve been changed, in typical Apple fashion, a move toward future-proofing with a fair bit of growing pains, like the SCSI and Ethernet ports, optical drive and headphone jack before it. Courage. In a few years, perhaps we’ll laugh about all of this, wondering what we were so up in arms about, content with the uniformity and ability to charge from each and load up our desks with giant 5K monitors. The road to transition, however, will be paved with adapters.</p><p>And then, of course, there’s the Touch Bar. Far and away the most compelling addition to the system, the skinny touchscreen Retina display offers a new input paradigm. It’s a way for the company to continue to avoid the Windows 10 route, eschewing full touchscreen functionality while still offering the ability for users to touch-poke a swipe at a proxy.</p><p>It’s a sort of halfway point between a touchpad and touchscreen that lets Apple have its cake and eat it too. It also opens up the system to some compelling new workflow and computing possibilities as more parties develop for the feature.</p><p>After four years without a fundamental refresh, Apple has returned with a system that builds up some of the system’s strongest selling points, while introducing some tricks, and a few pain points along the way.</p><p>The MacBook Pro has been a lot of things to a lot of people over the years, but the word “sleek” has never really applied. That was never really the point. The MacBook Pro has always been about being a powerhouse. It’s right there in the name, a product targeted toward the company’s base of creative professionals looking for something more portable than a desktop. Of course, that appeal has spilled over into other users simply looking for something with a little more under the hood than an Air.</p><p>The latest upgrade maintains much of the design language of its predecessor, while taking a few cues from the standard MacBook, with smoothed out lines and even fewer parts making up its unibody exterior. That long black plastic strip on the rear of the computer is gone. So too, interestingly, is the iconic glowing Apple on the lid, replaced, for better or worse, with a mirror version.</p><p>At 14.9 mm, the 13-inch version is 17 percent thinner than its predecessor. The 15-inch version is down 14 percent from the previous version, at 15.5 mm. The system volume is noticeably streamlined as well, down 23 and 20 percent, respectively, along with a half-pound weight drop for both laptops, down to three and four pounds apiece. It’s not exactly night and day — and the 15-inch version will still feel pretty massive for those who have been carrying around an Air for all this time, but as someone who’s schlepped the previous system around for hundreds of miles on convention center floors, it’s undoubtedly an upgrade.</p><p>And the build quality here is undeniable. The new MacBook Pro is a beautifully designed piece of machinery, enhanced by the edition of the MacBook’s Space Gray coloring, a dark, almost gun-metal shading that plays well into the overall sleekness of the machine. The more traditional silver coloring has survived the upgrade, as well, so if you’re partial to a light shade, you can tick off that option during the check-out process.</p><p>Asked about the end of the SD slot, an outspoken Apple VP told The Independent that it was “bit of a cumbersome slot,” referring not to the port so much in its inert form so much as how the whole thing looks with a card sticking out its side. I’ll confess that I’ve come pretty close on numerous occasions to accidentally snapping a card in half after forgetting that I’d left it in the computer, but the word cumbersome never crossed my mind.</p><p>And as plenty of tech pundits have been more than happy to point out, an adapter is a heck of a lot more cumbersome than half of an SD card. It’s a strange sort of calculus, one that seems to point to a company more focused on the beauty of its hardware in a stationary position, recalling shades of the iPhone 7’s headphone jack adapter and the MacBook Air’s standalone optical drive. And perhaps more to the point, it marks the end of a feature that spoke directly to photographers and videographers who have been longtime devotees to Apple’s hardware.</p><p>The loss of the SD slot is likely to have less of a direct impact on more mainstream consumers, but the impact of the move to four uniform USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports will be felt almost immediately. For Apple, the update marks a bold step into a future in which USB-C makes up the majority of peripherals. And we’re no doubt moving in that direction. Meantime, adapters. A</p>",

This is Hike’s first acquisition.</p><p>Zip Phone, which launched last year and was founded by Indian entrepreneur Anuj Jain, lets users make secure, Wi-Fi-enabled phone calls. This means they don’t have to use up minutes on limited smartphone calling plans or incur roaming charges. Hike founder and CEO Kavin Bharti Mittal says acquiring Zip Phone will allow the messaging app to bring a free voice calling feature, one of its most requested features from users, to the market much more quickly.</p><p>It’s easy to see how Zip Phone fits into Hike’s business strategy. While there are scores of messaging apps based in Asia (including WeChat, Line, and KakaoTalk), Hike has several features designed specifically for consumers in India where data plans are often costly, including Hike2SMS, or free SMS credits for featurephones, and message notifications that pop up even if users have turned data off.</p><p>In addition to India, Hike is also keen to acquire users in international markets, including Europe and Latin America.</p><p>Hike claims to currently have over 35 million users, with 90 percent residing in India. It has raised $86 million from Tiger Global and BSB.</p>",

The long lines from Friday, along with high selling prices on eBay that are hitting 20x the original Spectacles spelling price, suggest a lot of people could be looking to pick them up – but the somewhat remote location might make for a very different scene.</p><p>If you’re curious about what it’s like to use Spectacles feel free to check out the first impressions of TC’s Editor-in-Chief and resident hypebeat Matthew Panzarino, but everyday users seem to love the things, too, so if you don’t mind a lineup (plus beautiful California coastal highway views) and you’re in the area, there’s probably no reason not to go down and get in line.</p><p>The second location indicates that contrary to prevailing theories, Snapchat won’t be making Snapbots available first at big urban centers like SF and New York. Instead, the company seems to want to provoke some interesting road trips with its rollout strategy – something which may, in part, be driven by Spectacle inventory scarcity, but which also finds with its brand advertising, wherein beautiful millennial take beautiful road trips while enjoying the social app.</p><p>The Snapbot is at The Big Sur Bakery according to people on Twitter, so you can also carbo load while you’re picking up some Specs.</p>",

    "content": "<p>It’s still practically a newborn but Indian mobile messaging app Hike is already channelling almost a billion messages a month between its five million registered users. Those numbers sound insignificant when you stack them up against the big beasts of the messaging space – WhatsApp claims 200 million+ monthly active users, and some 600 billion in and outbound messages – but Hike’s growth is  impressive when you consider it’s only just over four months old. WhatsApp, of course, has been around for almost four years.</p><p>Mobile messaging is hot property right now, with tech giants like Facebook and most recently Google bent on owning the messaging space. The reason for all this interest in cross-platform chit-chat is that mobile messaging looks poised to steal social networking’s crown jewels: aka the cool factor, and thus the user engagement (Hike incorporates social status updates and emoji-based moods into its messaging app, to hang on the social chain). But the idea that there can be one ultimate mobile messaging winner — or one player as dominant as Facebook in the full-fat social networking space — seems unlikely. And that’s what Hike is banking on to disrupt WhatsApp and keep Facebook Messenger and its ilk from crashing its just-getting-started party.</p><p>There’s no doubt that local market realities intercede much more on mobile than on the traditional social networking playground of the desktop, especially in emerging markets where device, network and carrier variations influence how people communicate based on how they can afford to communicate. Those complexities provide an opportunity for local app makers to triumph over goliath outsiders if they build fixes for the local market, argues Hike.</p><p>“Given how competitive this market is we do feel that in about 3 or 5 years from now you will have somewhere between three to five players globally that own parts of the messaging space in the world. You’re already seeing it right now, you have Line in Japan, you have Kakao in Korea, you have WeChat in China, you have WhatsApp in South America and Europe, you have of course Facebook message or iMessage dominating in U. S. and WhatsApp growing there too. In India of course WhatsApp is the dominant player but we’ve come on to be a very strong number two in just four months,” says Hike creator Kavin Mittal.</p><p>“We can see that with communication if you solve local problems in the market there is room for a local player to win the market completely.”</p><p>Hike is one of the latest contenders to jump into the mobile messaging space, albeit with a few neat tricks up its sleeve that it’s confident will allow it to grab significant share in its chosen markets — namely India, and other similar emerging markets in place like Indonesia, the Middle East and Africa. Some 60% of Hike’s registered users are in India, 40% globally led by the Middle East and Germany (despite its emerging markets focus, Germany was actually the first market to spike an interest in Hike — which its creator puts down to it having 128bit encryption over Wi-Fi and Germans looking for a “much more secure solution to WhatsApp”).</p><p>On the neat tricks front, Hike has baked a patent-pending SMS conversion tool into its app to take advantage of fragmentation in the Indian market caused by low distribution of data-capable smartphones. So this is not just about incorporating SMS messages into a unified app — as Google plans to with its Hangouts app — but about making sure a data message can still reach someone who doesn’t have data, via the SMS channel.</p><p>Mittal explains that in India, even where people own smartphones they may not have data enabled, or  may sporadically turn data off to save money. SMS is therefore still a key comms channel that needed to be brought into the loop. This fragmentation was the problem the app’s creators were setting out to solve with Hike. They have also done this in as low cost a way as possible by building a system that ensures it does not send cross-network SMSes (which incur a termination fee in India) but routes same network to same network.</p><p>“The idea behind Hike… is it works free globally. Hike is available on iPhone, Windows, Android S40, S60, very soon BlackBerry now as well. But in case you don’t have a phone than can install Hike, or let’s say you have a phone but you don’t have data, I can still message you from Hike for free. We convert the IP message into an SMS and it’s free for me as a Hike user, to which you can reply back to – and the reply comes back straight to my inbox making messaging very  seamless. So I have one app for all my friends,”  Mittal tells TechCrunch.</p><p>Another future trick — due to launch on June 10 — is something that will allow users who have turned off their data to still be notified that they have a message waiting for them, presumably so they know to turn data back on. “At this point in the market there’s no way to notify you when you have a message waiting on one of these applications. So we’re launching something on June 10th that’s going to solve this problem, so no matter where you are – no matter if you’re online or offline – you’ll be able to communicate via Hike with your friend all the time,” he adds.</p><p>Hike is funding the conversion cost of sending the SMSes itself —  in the Indian market, with a view to extending it to other emerging markets with similar dynamics — so that is one of its largest sunk costs at the moment, according to Mittal. But its monetisation strategy is based on building off that base in another way. The shift Hike’s creators are ultimately calculating on is the movement of consumer spending in its target emerging markets away from carrier ‘value add services’ — paid for infotainment SMSes and so on — to data-based content and entertainment.</p><p>That’s where Hike sees its future profits, by fleshing out its messaging offering to supplement the bread and butter of social comms with “content that’s very relevant to the local market” — much as the Line me</p>",

Unlike the company’s $20 certificate, which directly competes with established English tests like the TOEFL, the quick test isn’t remotely verified by a human. With that, Duolingo’s main cost in offering the certificate is gone and the company is hence able to offer this test for free. The main idea here is to create a new standard for displaying language skills on resumes.</p><p>“These are largely self-assessed today (“I’m intermediate in French”) and therefore unlikely to be taken seriously by institutions,” the company notes in today’s announcement.</p><p>A company spokesperson told me that the difference in content between the paid Certificate test and the Quick test is small. The Certificate test with 21 questions and 152 sub-items takes about 20 minutes and the Quick Test, which features 15 questions with 110 sub-items should take about 15 minutes. (Correction: Duolingo initially provided us with the wrong number of questions on the Quick Test. The correct number is 110 and not 150. We’ve updated the post to reflect this.)</p><p>Users can take the Quick Test both on Duolingo’s Test Center website and through its Test Center app on Android.</p><p>The more people who come on the platform and start using the free test, the more likely it is that these users will also want to get the full certificate at some point. If anything, these free tests will allow users to check their own language abilities and prepare for exams without having to pay for them.</p><p>The second announcement marks a first for both Duolingo, as well as its new partner Uber. In Colombia, Uber will now use Duolingo to certify your driver’s English skills (using the paid $20 certificate test, not the new free Quick Test).</p><p>Uber tells me about 60 drivers have already completed the program and over 1,000 Uber drivers are currently in the process of using the service to certify their English test and foreign visitors in Colombia, where Uber is active in Barranquilla, Medellin, Cali and Bogotá, can now request an UberEnglish driver.</p><p>I’ve taken my fair share of taxi rides around Colombia and I’ve never felt unsafe, but I can see why a foreign visitor with minimal Spanish skills would want a driver who speaks English.</p><p>Using UberEnglish will cost riders about $1,500 Colombian pesos extra and the option is available for both UberX and regular Uber rides.</p><p>The plan is to launch this service across other major cities in Latin America later this year.</p>",

    "content": "<p>This week, WhatsApp passed a milestone when CEO Jan Koum revealed that it had broken 800 million active users. That’s quite something in this age, when the leading global social networks and Internet services are well established. Breaking into that club isn’t easy, but WhatsApp has done it — nearly doubling its user base over the past year, since it was acquired by Facebook for an eye-popping $19 billion.</p><p>Yet, impressive as those numbers are, there is something troubling about this new data point.</p><p>At this point, most people know the difference between these two metrics. Monthly active users is a more accurate way to measure the reach and engagement of a service — but it is far from definitive.</p><p>To suggest that MAUs provide a true picture of a business and its user base is at best naive, or at worst misleading.</p><p>“We aren’t giving any additional data beyond the 800M MAUs,” a WhatsApp spokesperson told TechCrunch after we got in touch to ask for more info.</p><p>For example, I could open WhatsApp just once in a month — for five minutes over a 30-day period — and I’d be counted as one of its 800 million ‘active’ users. That’s more than a little off. (And I’m not even thinking about those who use the service ‘twice’ via dual SIM phones.)</p><p>Messaging apps are core services; they are meant to be used more regularly than once a month because we talk to our friends, families and colleagues on a daily basis.</p><p>A better metric to gauge WhatsApp’s traction might be the number of weekly or monthly users, messages sent between users, messages per user per day, etc.</p><p>That’s easy for me to say, of course. WhatsApp prefers to keep this data to itself. Which is fine — it is quite within its rights to do so. But professing that revealing MAU figures exposes the truth behind the numbers is plain false.</p><p>It isn’t just about quibbling over numbers; there’s an important business issue here. The next stage of messaging is rapidly coming, and it’s a time when the local network of a service is of critical importance.</p><p>There are only so many ways that you can monetize chat while maintaining the user experience. As Facebook showed when it launched its Messenger platform, the future is connecting services — such as payments, business-to-consumer communication and more. In Asia, commerce and online-to-offline services are increasingly a focus for messaging apps.</p><p>The critical fact here is the strength of a local network. It doesn’t matter how many users you have across the world. If you don’t have a solid base in a particular country, then roping in local service partners to build out the business is a challenge.</p><p>For example, Kakao Talk in Korea has fewer than 200 million registered users and probably under 100 million of them are active on a monthly basis.</p><p>Yet, in Korea, its app is installed on over 95 percent of smartphones. That makes launching a taxi-booking feature, payments and other services a no-brainer because retailers and others know there is a captive audience that they can tap right into.</p><p>Kakao has been profitable since 2013, and last year it merged with local internet giant Daum in a $3 billion deal. It did miss the global opportunity for messaging, but its Korean business is nonetheless evidence of where messaging is headed.</p><p>WhatsApp has 800 million ‘monthly active users’ worldwide. We know that it is particularly huge in India, with over 70 million monthly active users, but it isn’t clear where else its network is strong with highly engaged users.</p><p>That’s important because in the future, if it looks to monetize beyond a $1 annual fee, it will need strength and depth in local markets to make its platform appealing.</p><p>It seems likely WhatsApp will win out in India and parts of Europe and the Middle East, but it has lost the top markets in Asia (China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan) and is up against a range of competitors in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world. The U. S. market is also hugely challenging given the high usage of iMessage, and competitors like Kik and Snapchat.</p><p>That’s a very different picture to “800 million monthly active users,” which implies world domination.</p><p>Another factor I’ve heard plenty of industry chatter about is that a large proportion of WhatsApp users are not on Android and iOS devices. Getting its service to market on such phones is a real testament to the engineering capabilities of WhatsApp — and its popularity in Africa and Latin America — but introducing additional services to these users on BlackBerry, Windows Phone or Symbian is technically challenging and probably not possible.</p><p>That’s another issue for WhatsApp to contend with as it looks to develop from a communications utility into a lucrative business.</p><p>So, while 800 million MAUs is an impressive statistic, remember that it is only that: just another statistic.</p>",

They use DroneBase to track progress at their work sites, measure areas and resources, verify insurance claims on roofs, shoot aerial marketing footage of properties, and more. Clients just input their needs, and DroneBase dispatches a pilot with all the skills and hardware necessary to get the job done.</p><p>Dan Burton, DroneBase’s founder and CEO, tells me it’s been “really rewarding” to pay some pilots as much as $50,000 a year. Meanwhile, DroneBase is on track to boost its revenue 700% from 2015 to 2016.</p><p>The potential to crowdsource the future of enterprise drone usage has attracted a $3 million Series A for DroneBase. Previous investor Union Square Ventures and its top dog Fred Wilson led the round. Burton says, “Every interaction with them, they just increase our trust, even when they’re telling us something hard to hear.”</p><p>The round, which brings DroneBase to just over $5 million in funding, was joined by Upfront Ventures, Accel Partners, and DJI. Also based in the startup’s hometown, Burton says Upfront’s access to talent in Los Angeles has been a big help.</p><p>DJI has become DroneBase’s most important partner. DroneBase requires pilots to exclusively use the Chinese manufacturer’s hardware in order to standardize the footage collected. “All the jobs we’ve done, we’ve done every single one on a DJI drone” Burton says. “It removes hardware as a variable.” For example, DroneBase did monthly check-ups on 40 construction sites across the country for one company, and the reports from Arizona and Florida are directly comparable.</p><p>The funding will fuel DroneBase’s invasion of new verticals. When it started in 2014, DroneBase focused on collecting beautiful shots from the sky for real estate marketers. It’s grown into insurance, construction, and mining. Now it wants to advance its business with solar companies and telecom infrastructure owners. ”</p><p>“We’re actively flying in all 50 US states and 30 countries” Burton beams. “Any address in the United States, we can get you drone imagery and data in 48 hours, for almost always under $500.”</p><p>Wait time and prices could drop even further now that civilians can join DroneBase’s Pilot Program. “80% of people who buy a drone, they go out and fly it three or four times, and then it’s collecting cobwebs in their garage” Burton says. Better to put them to use.</p><p>DroneBase has over a million properties it believes would benefit from drone footage. Burton thinks it can sell their owners deeper data for much cheaper than what it would cost to buy a drone and hire a pilot, get helicopter or satellite imagery, or precariously dangle a human from a ladder or harness.</p><p>DroneBase will have to hope regulation keeps it easy for licensed pilots to fly these quick missions. Plus, plenty of other startups want to be DroneBnB too. There’s are legitimate competitors like Skycatch, as well as lots of drone-for-hire sites like Air-Vid, Droners.io, and HireAUAVPro. Still, DroneBase’s biggest foe remains the status quo of not having aerial footage or data at all.</p><p>But as big businesses realize the high value of drones and the high costs of ownership and operation, more will look to pilot marketplaces like DroneBase. “The obsolescence is ridiculous” Burton concludes. “You spend $100,000 on a fleet of drones and it will be obsolete in 6 months.” Why buy the drone when you can get the flights for cheap?</p>",

The latterâ€™s own keyboard scheduling app Meet has also been closed. Leaving someÂ unhappy Sunrise fans looking for their next calendar app. And ThingThing pulling out the stops to be able toÂ offer them a fully featured alternative. Which it now reckons it can.</p><p>ThingThing, a Barcelona-based startup,Â launched its third party iOS keyboard app over a year ago, with an initial focus on smoothing the pain of app switching by letting users do more within the keyboard itself by integrating with a variety of third party services.Â The team has since closed a $400,000 seed round.</p><p>So with ThingThing you can, for instance, pull in photos from your camera roll, view appointments in your calendar, grab files from Dropbox, Box or Google Drive, see your contacts, view your Todoist tasks, see whatâ€™s in your Pocket, and eyeball stuff on your Instagram or Facebook.Â All without leaving whatever other app youâ€™re using because ThingThing livesÂ within the keyboard panel (itÂ also has its own predictive keyboard).</p><p>Now, with its latest app update, ThingThing isÂ touting the launch of â€˜Calendar 2.0â€™, wherebyÂ the flagship new featureÂ is the ability to send meeting invites right within the keyboard â€” including for one-to-one and for group meetingsâ€Ś So basically theÂ Sunrise Meet killer app.</p><p>ThingThing CEO and co-founder Olivier Plante has even been taking to Twitter toÂ encourage Sunrise fans to download ThingThingâ€Ś Which is certainly a quicker route to recovering in-keyboard meeting scheduling vsÂ hoping/waiting for Microsoft to add it to Outlookâ€Ś</p><p>â€œA lot of users have asked us to create invites directly from the keyboard just like Sunrise Meet, and we did,â€ says Plante. â€œThe whole back end of creating meetings, making sure itâ€™s easy for usersâ€Ś we did it all, and more neat additions are coming up!â€</p><p>If youâ€™re using the featureÂ to invite a non-ThingThing user to a meeting they wonâ€™t need to download the app to accept â€” rather it will email them a link to a meeting invite where they can respond. And, if they accept, theyâ€™ll getÂ a calendar invite emailed back to them.</p><p>While the calendar is the big focus for this update, another new addition lets ThingThing users manage their Todoist to-do list inside the keyboard â€” so they can now create tasks within the keyboard and save a task from a message by holding and copying any text while the appÂ is active, which will trigger an option to â€˜Save insideâ€™. Todoist tasks can also be marked as complete and shared via the app.</p><p>â€œFor now, we supportÂ Todoist but weâ€™ll shortly rollout other integrations such as Wunderlist, Evernote, OneNote, Trello, Asana, etc,â€ adds Plante. â€œToward a keyboard as a platform!â€</p>",

The simple concept of doodling on pictures of my friends on Snapchat was what I first fell in love with, then came stories and the rest was history. I was hooked â€“ which makes me basically the ideal test case for Spectacles.</p><p>Since then, Snapchat has exploded and morphed from a silly distraction during class into a worldwide social media phenomenon. And after hearing about the Spectacles launch on Twitter I was even more excited about Snapâ€™s future. I wasnâ€™t sure if I was going to buy them, but I knew they were going to be huge.</p><p>Believe it or not, a man in an Elmo costume convinced me to buy Spectacles. While taking a phone call on the roof of my office overlooking Santa Monica 3rd St. Promenade, A man in an Elmo costume was surrounded and arrested by multiple police officers. I wanted to capture the moment, but couldnâ€™t â€“ my phone was pressed against my ear. All I could think about was how easily it could have been recordable with a pair of Spectacles.</p><p>My fascination quickly turned into an obsession. I dug around on the Spectacles website, trying to figure out when theyâ€™d launch or how the online shop would work. I tweeted up a storm trying to see if anybody knew anything. As luck would have it, the first Snapbot appeared in Venice the very next morning.</p><p>The line was four and a half hours deep when I arrived Friday morning. The Snapbot was refilled three separate times (we estimated the Snapbot can hold about 200 Spectacles, so that means around 800 or so sold throughout the day). Me and those around me played games in line, sharing inside jokes about the Valley while we marched forward toward the blinking, yellow box on the side of the street. When I finally arrived to the Snapbot, I was informed I could only purchase one â€“ normally customers can buy as many as two, but they were running out. I plugged my credit card in, and they were mine.</p><p>Setup was fairly simple: You just put them on, open up the Snapchat pairing screen, and press the record button on the glasses. It took about fifteen seconds to pair, after which you can name your Specs. While a name might seem trivial, it plays an important role: only standard definition footage streams automatically to Snapchat. If you want to save HD footage, you need to connect over WiFi, using a network that uses your Spectaclesâ€™ name. Itâ€™s the lone pain in the ass of using them overall. In the end I named my Specs â€œInSPECtor Gadget đŸ˜Žâ€. Yeah, I know. Iâ€™m a nerd.</p><p>I like to think of my new Spectacles first and foremost as sunglasses. Theyâ€™re significantly cheaper than a pair of Ray-Bans ($129 for Specs vs. around $169), come with nicer lenses, the frames are beautiful, and they weigh only slightly more. And the image quality from the camera? Spec-tacular.</p><p>Recording a Snap is as easyÂ as tapping the top left of the frame. An inner white light shines into your eyes to indicate a live recording, and the LED ring begins to spin on the outside. The default duration is ten seconds, and the inner light will begin to flash as a warning three seconds before the recording stops. Want to continue? Just hit the frame again, and it will queue up another ten seconds of video.</p><p>I didnâ€™t even realize the Spectacles had batteries. I used them quite heavily in the first few days and didnâ€™t run out of juice. The charging case is great for when Iâ€™m inside or back home and not snapping, and it tops them up each night for a whole new day of adventures. The Specs donâ€™t always line up with the charging case on the first try, but this is some â€œfirst generation iPhone stuffâ€ here as my good friend, David Byttow, remarked.</p><p>To fully test out the Spectacles experience, I took over the Product Hunt Snapchat for a day. Theyâ€™re great for capturing both the mundane and interesting aspects of my life in Santa Monica that my friends otherwise wouldnâ€™t get to see, like sitting in traffic on the 10 Freeway on my way to work.</p><p>After reviewing my videos from the past few days, the perspective was completely different and more accurate than anything Iâ€™ve seen apart from a GoPro strapped to my head. Circular video is the closest digital media format to replicating what we see and remember in our memories.</p><p>Everyone on Product Hunt, my friends, and even my little brother loved turning their phones to see the video from my (circular) point of view.</p><p>Even if I donâ€™t use the camera, my Spectacles are a keeper: theyâ€™re the perfect pair of sunglasses, and itâ€™s reassuring to know that I can capture something without fumbling through my pockets looking for my phone. If you donâ€™t tend to wear sunglasses regularly, they can be slightly intrusive or bothersome, but I can only imagine that as Spectacles become more commonplace, versions with clear lenses will be released for indoor use as well.</p><p>In-app purchases (IAPâ€™s) are a distinct possibility in the near future for Spectacles users. Snapchat founder and CEO Evan Spiegel once remarked that Snap, Inc would try to make its money using IAPs.</p><p>While this wonâ€™t likely be Snapâ€™s main source of revenue, it could become increasingly important as they build an arsenal of tools to better document and share your life either with your friends or, more importantly, for yourself.</p><p>I actually found myself routinely snapping experiences that I wanted to keep just for myself â€” the default choice of keeping every video private was a brilliant product move, and you could see them unlocking more tools for both private preservation and public sharing via IAP.</p><p>The Spectacles are also loaded with sensors and microphones that have the abilityÂ to accept voice commands, tap gestures, and more. All of that is filled with potential, wrapped in a simple Trojan horse of a quirky pair of sunglasses rea</p>",

Google’s near ubiquitous electronic mail application is getting some key upgrades for version 5.0.3, including, notably, a revamped UI that makes it look just like the native Android version of the app.</p><p>Along with a more defined color scheme and more well pronounced icons, the new look (for iOS, at least) brings with it some subtle but important chances to the experience that should speed things up over all, bringing performance a lot closer to its Android counterpart.</p><p>Among the changes are better transitions and intuitive features like the ability to swipe on a message to archive or delete it, depending on which you opt for in the app’s own settings page. Search has been sped up, too, populating faster and giving you quicker suggestions when you spell something wrong.</p><p>Perhaps biggest of all here (depending on your predisposition for remorse) is the addition of Undo Send, a momentary reprieve from your own dumb mistakes. Send an email and small, dark gray bar pops up at the bottom. Click “Undo” during the fairly short window and boom, the message doesn’t go through, transforming back into the draft version you were working on before sending. After that, however, you’re on your own.</p>",

Or to enjoy the financial returns of the exit. No, as a Japanese expat in London as COO of Quipper, she wanted to create a dating services that matches Asian singles who are based overseas.</p><p>“In London, I wanted to meet someone who shared my culture and language, and could talk to my parents. It was very hard on existing dating sites because they tend to group all Asians together. I thought: “There’s JDate for Jewish matches, and a number for black people, why isn’t there one for Asians?””</p><p>Thus she went ahead and founded East Meets East.</p><p>The New York-based service that is currently active in six cities in the U. S.. Rather than Tinder, Tokioka describes it as a matchmaking service. That’s to say that users find each other through shared likes, activities and interests and, if they like what they see, they can message the other person. It is geared towards ‘romance’ rather than ‘hooking up.’</p><p>The service is available on the web and an iOS app, with an Android app likely to come some point in early 2017. The company is working on artificial intelligence to help make matches more relevant.</p><p>East Meets East is free for women, but men who want to join are charged $30 per month.</p><p>“It’s basically ladies night concept,” Tokioka explained. “Statistically Asian women are wanted more [by men of other ethnicities], but Asian men are not so much desired.”</p><p>Straight to the point, perhaps, but she said that most of the company’s target male audience are ok with paying, while most can afford it, too. She wouldn’t be drawn on the number of users that the service has, but said the total has grown three-fold over the past year.</p><p>One key user acquisition channel for new users has been YouTube celebrities, Tokioka said. Some of those that East Meets East have worked with include the Fung Brothers, David So, Linda Dong and Wong-Fu Production’s ISATV.</p><p>“Asian Americans are the fastest growing minority group in the U. S., which grew 56 percent from 2000 to 2013, and surpassed the 15 million mark in the United States. Globally, 60 percent of the world population lives in Asia accounting for more than 4.4 billion people,” Tokioka added in a statement.</p><p>With that global data in mind, Tokioka said that East Meets East plans to expand into Asia where it will stick to its guns and help match singles from the same background and culture. Initially, the plan is to expand to all parts of the U. S. over the next nine months and, following that, Tokioka wants to move into Canada, Australia, the UK and Hong Kong.</p><p>East Meets East revealed today that it has raised $1 million of initial funding from 500 Startups, East Ventures, Japanese games firm DeNA, iSGS Investment Works, and Shintaro Yamada, founder of Japan-based unicorn Mercari. Tokioka said that the company, which currently has 10 staff, will look to raise more money next year ahead of its international expansion.</p>",

    "content": "<p>One of the cofounders of Accel Partners and DCM, Dixon Doll, recently formed a new venture firm called Impact Venture Capital, along with Jack Crawford and Eric Ball.</p><p>Ball previously served as Oracle’s Treasurer, where he helped manage $50 billion in assets. And Crawford was previously an investor and founded Velocity Venture Capital. Both are also former Kauffman fellows.</p><p>The firm is hosting their first annual Impact Global Venture Summit in Sacramento tonight to connect fundraising companies to angel investors, venture capital firms, and corporate venture groups.</p><p>Impact VC has already quietly backed a couple of companies, Nightingale Security and Cornami.</p><p>According to Nightingale Security CEO and co-founder Jack Wu, his startup’s technology includes drones and software that can “replace security guards” and protect the perimeter of any large venue or corporate campus.</p><p>Its robotic, aerial security systems are installed “on-prem,” or behind the firewall of any given company’s network. Therefore, they can be used in highly sensitive settings like at a high-security prison, film studio, or large industrial operation such as a factory, solar farm or data center.</p><p>Wu will be speaking at the Drone World Expo in San Jose on Tuesday as part of a panel examining how robotics and drones specifically are transforming the physical security industry.</p><p>Cornami, formerly known as Sviral, has developed technology that reduces latency and power consumption in high-performance computing, employing multi-core processors used in parallel.</p><p>While the partners at Impact Venture Capital declined to reveal any fund-specific details, they were able to speak to their investment philosophy broadly.</p><p>Doll told TechCrunch that Impact Venture Capital seeks to back early stage companies, strictly. Why? The veteran of venture capital said:</p><p>“With early stage, seed and Series A rounds you have the most uncertainty and risk there. But if you actively manage the companies and the portfolio itself, you will realize the greatest returns.</p><p>All the data from Cambridge, and others, bears this out… When you look back over the decades, the top performing returns come from early stage firms by and large.</p><p>This stage is also where you can provide the real business development part of venture, as opposed to just writing checks and staying largely on the sidelines.”</p><p>Eric Ball added that Impact VC has an interest in startups developing new technology that can “cut across multiple customer verticals.” Areas of interest include: the internet of things, artificial intelligence, data analytics, robotics, and telecommunications media technology (TMT). Ball said:</p><p>“Some investors want to specialize and create silos around their space. But many technologies don’t respect silos. Nightingale is a good example of this. They can use drones to replace human security guards, but the same drones could be sent to inspect a solar panel or be sent to measure moisture levels in crops.”</p><p>Impact VC has offices in Burlingame and Sacramento but extensive international connections, with limited partners and prior co-investors based around the world, especially in Israel, Germany, Japan, China and the U. K.</p><p>Why start an early stage firm in 2016, it seems like there are so many?</p><p>“There’s a dynamic going on where in the last several quarters, VC’s have raised more money than at any point in history, yet have been deploying less capital than at any point in the last 10 years.</p><p>Firms are hoarding dollars because they assume it will take a very long time for a startup to exit. So they’re doing fewer deals and reserving more money for follow on rounds. Self-inflicted scarcity can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. But this creates opportunity for folks who are willing to deploy capital now,” Ball explained.</p><p>Dixon Doll added that VC investors need to remain patient, and keep an open mind about where to find liquidity in this next cycle.</p><p>“For the VC industry to be healthy we’ve got to have a wide set of exit opportunities, including IPOs as well as mergers and acquisitions. One of the new factors that’s helping solve at least part of this problem is that a lot of VC backed companies are exiting by selling out to PE firms that specialize in target sectors. We expect that trend to continue. But it’s important not to be impatient just because we are weathering an IPO drought,” he said.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, when they firm says “impact,” it’s not about a double or triple-bottom line, but pure financial returns.</p><p>That said, Impact VC does want to help foundations, including philanthropic ones, to invest and growth their wealth wisely, Ball said.</p>",

When Hike bought Y Combinator-backed Zip Phone, which allows users to make Wi-Fi-enabled phone calls, CEO Kavin Bharti Mittal said that it would allow the company to add free voice-calling, one of its most requested features from users, much more quickly.</p><p>Its latest Android update means that Hike has managed to add a voice-calling feature before Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which is significant because WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in India, with over 70 million monthly active users, or about 10 percent of its global user base.</p><p>WhatsApp has promised to add voice-calling features by early 2015, but it’s still unclear when exactly it will be available.

Android users account for over 90 percent of Hike’s users.</p><p>Like other Hike features, including free SMS credits for featurephones, its voice-calling feature is designed to be data-efficient since data plans are relatively costly in India.

    "content": "<p>Alibaba has sharpened its focus on India after it made a second investment in Paytm, a mobile payments and e-commerce business.</p><p>The investment was made by Alibaba and Ant Financial, the Chinese firm’s financial services affiliate which made an undisclosed investment in Paytm February via a deal that reportedly valued the Indian company at more than $1 billion. This new deal is also undisclosed; however India’s Economic Times reports that Alibaba is spending $680 million to buy 20 percent of Paytm. That lowers Ant Financial’s stake from 25 percent to 20 percent, the report added. So, in essence, Alibaba is now making a firmer commitment having tested the water via the Ant Financial deal.</p><p>Paytm, which grew and was spun out of mobile content company One97, bears much similarity to Alibaba’s own constellation of businesses, albeit that it is far less developed. It offers a range of financial-focused services in India, including a mobile wallet app (used by Uber, among others), online recharge (for topping up phone credit and more), and a shopping service. The company said it has been working on “synergies” with Alibaba since taking funding in February, and its e-commerce marketplace is a particular area of focus given that Alibaba practically pioneered the genre in China with its Taobao site.</p><p>Paytm claims more than 100 million users of its wallet service, which helps Indians buy items online without the need for a credit/debit card or banking. The startup said the Paytm Wallet clocks more than 75 million transactions each month.</p><p>Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and CEO of Paytm said the company is looking “to bring half a billion Indians to the mainstream economy and help millions of small businesses leverage this large m-commerce opportunity.”</p><p>That’s very much along the lines of Alibaba and Ant Financial’s own raison d’être. Alibaba’s e-commerce services have opened Internet commerce to vendors of all sizes in China, while Ant Financial — which is independent of Alibaba and valued in the $45-50 billion bracket — has introduced a range of banking services, including its own virtual bank and flexible, micro loans.</p><p>With India becoming a more prominent target for U. S. firms than China, as the New York Times recently noted, Alibaba is making its move into India via Paytm.</p><p>“India is an important emerging market with strong e-commerce potential, and we look forward to partnering with Paytm to deliver innovative products and services to consumers… This investment will further expand Alibaba Group’s global footprint to India’s thriving mobile commerce market,” Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said in a statement.</p>",

    "content": "<p>My MacBook Pro is on its last legs. The anti-glare laminate began bubbling up some time ago, spreading across the screen like an untreatable rash, fogging up the webcam in the process. The hinge is loose, so the screen shakes when someone walks by. The little black rubber bumpers have fallen off the bottom and, every so often, there’s an audible buzz of a fan rumbling from under the hood that can only be silenced with a swift smack by the heel of my hand. Also, the battery’s been having issues for a while.</p><p>My 2012 MacBook Pro has been through a lot. It’s traveled the world in a carry-on and survived several Apple live blogs and CESes, attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion and C-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. I’ve promised to put it out to pasture many times over, patiently awaiting the company to offer a truly meaningful refresh of the line, but each year I’ve held out, largely unimpressed by what the company has had to offer as it diverted resources to other product lines.</p><p>Now, finally, the time has come. A full four years after the last major upgrade, the new MacBook Pro is finally here. It’s slimmer and lighter than its predecessor, while maintaining a majority of its iconic aluminum design language. The internals have been souped up, along with the keyboard, touchpad and speakers. There’s a lot to like here.</p><p>The ports have been — well, they’ve been changed, in typical Apple fashion, a move toward future-proofing with a fair bit of growing pains, like the SCSI and Ethernet ports, optical drive and headphone jack before it. Courage. In a few years, perhaps we’ll laugh about all of this, wondering what we were so up in arms about, content with the uniformity and ability to charge from each and load up our desks with giant 5K monitors. The road to transition, however, will be paved with adapters.</p><p>And then, of course, there’s the Touch Bar. Far and away the most compelling addition to the system, the skinny touchscreen Retina display offers a new input paradigm. It’s a way for the company to continue to avoid the Windows 10 route, eschewing full touchscreen functionality while still offering the ability for users to touch-poke a swipe at a proxy.</p><p>It’s a sort of halfway point between a touchpad and touchscreen that lets Apple have its cake and eat it too. It also opens up the system to some compelling new workflow and computing possibilities as more parties develop for the feature.</p><p>After four years without a fundamental refresh, Apple has returned with a system that builds up some of the system’s strongest selling points, while introducing some tricks, and a few pain points along the way.</p><p>The MacBook Pro has been a lot of things to a lot of people over the years, but the word “sleek” has never really applied. That was never really the point. The MacBook Pro has always been about being a powerhouse. It’s right there in the name, a product targeted toward the company’s base of creative professionals looking for something more portable than a desktop. Of course, that appeal has spilled over into other users simply looking for something with a little more under the hood than an Air.</p><p>The latest upgrade maintains much of the design language of its predecessor, while taking a few cues from the standard MacBook, with smoothed out lines and even fewer parts making up its unibody exterior. That long black plastic strip on the rear of the computer is gone. So too, interestingly, is the iconic glowing Apple on the lid, replaced, for better or worse, with a mirror version.</p><p>At 14.9 mm, the 13-inch version is 17 percent thinner than its predecessor. The 15-inch version is down 14 percent from the previous version, at 15.5 mm. The system volume is noticeably streamlined as well, down 23 and 20 percent, respectively, along with a half-pound weight drop for both laptops, down to three and four pounds apiece. It’s not exactly night and day — and the 15-inch version will still feel pretty massive for those who have been carrying around an Air for all this time, but as someone who’s schlepped the previous system around for hundreds of miles on convention center floors, it’s undoubtedly an upgrade.</p><p>And the build quality here is undeniable. The new MacBook Pro is a beautifully designed piece of machinery, enhanced by the edition of the MacBook’s Space Gray coloring, a dark, almost gun-metal shading that plays well into the overall sleekness of the machine. The more traditional silver coloring has survived the upgrade, as well, so if you’re partial to a light shade, you can tick off that option during the check-out process.</p><p>Asked about the end of the SD slot, an outspoken Apple VP told The Independent that it was “bit of a cumbersome slot,” referring not to the port so much in its inert form so much as how the whole thing looks with a card sticking out its side. I’ll confess that I’ve come pretty close on numerous occasions to accidentally snapping a card in half after forgetting that I’d left it in the computer, but the word cumbersome never crossed my mind.</p><p>And as plenty of tech pundits have been more than happy to point out, an adapter is a heck of a lot more cumbersome than half of an SD card. It’s a strange sort of calculus, one that seems to point to a company more focused on the beauty of its hardware in a stationary position, recalling shades of the iPhone 7’s headphone jack adapter and the MacBook Air’s standalone optical drive. And perhaps more to the point, it marks the end of a feature that spoke directly to photographers and videographers who have been longtime devotees to Apple’s hardware.</p><p>The loss of the SD slot is likely to have less of a direct impact on more mainstream consumers, but the impact of the move to four uniform USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports will be felt almost immediately. For Apple, the update marks a bold step into a future in which USB-C makes up the majority of peripherals. And we’re no doubt moving in that direction. Meantime, adapters. A</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Silicon Valley “tech bubble” is a popular topic of discussion among business pundits, entrepreneurs and analysts who have dissected and predicted the upcoming “burst” for nearly the last decade. For all the talk of winter is coming and a slowdown in private capital markets, it’s hard to say if, or when, this will ever come to a head — at least in Silicon Valley.</p><p>But there’s no question a tech bubble is emerging, just not where you might think.</p><p>Overvalued startups focused on growth over revenue are a problem that stretches far beyond U. S. borders, and it’s an even bigger problem in India. Granted, a tech bubble bursting in India isn’t going to send shock waves through the ecosystem worldwide, let alone the public markets in that country, as it would in the U.S. However, it will impact the pace of innovation and investor risk appetite in the short-term in India and other emerging markets (other than China, the behemoth outlier) who share similar market characteristics (like Brazil, Indonesia and Nigeria).</p><p>The successes — or failures — from what works for the Indian consumer in their home market translates to the rest of the world significantly more so than following the successful models of companies like Alibaba, Tencent and others in China. Even if you don’t care about other emerging markets, experts agree India will soon be the most important economy in the world.</p><p>Much of India’s future success depends on whether the government can leverage its demographic potential by training its workforce and providing adequate infrastructure for businesses. This challenge is compounded by where the growth in mobile consumers is occurring. According to The Economist, India will see more people come online in the next 15 years than any other country, with the majority of that growth coming from rural, not urban areas.</p><p>These new mobile consumers will generally be poorer and lack the purchasing power needed to support a booming tech sector. While India’s internet and smartphone penetration is growing incredibly fast, this does not directly translate either into users having the ability to buy voraciously like their Chinese counterparts or new companies able to deliver goods in a timely fashion to rural communities.</p><p>More to the point, mobile data plans in India, like other emerging markets, do not make the robust use of the internet possible for the vast majority of people. That is not a simple problem to fix, but it is certainly easier to resolve than trying to improve livelihoods and logistics from the top down. Plus, the regulatory context in the country leaves a lot to be desired — just ask Facebook about “digital colonialism” related to its “Free Basics” initiative.</p><p>Morgan Stanley released a report earlier this year estimating e-commerce sales in India of $119 billion in 2020 — a seven-fold increase from its 2015 prediction. Travel is expected to account for 60 percent or more of e-commerce, with electronics coming in at 30 percent, according to the Boston Consulting Group and Retailers Association of India. A four- to seven-fold increase in market size does not seem too crazy — until you pair it with e-commerce startup valuations in India.</p><p>Look at the top e-commerce company in India — Flipkart, most recently valued at $15 billion. That is just shy of Morgan Stanley’s estimate for the entire e-commerce market in the country, and does not even include the next two competitors, Snapdeal and Amazon India. Flipkart has approximately 45 percent market share, which means the company should have roughly $7 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) in 2015 using Morgan Stanley’s calculations. So the company is basically valued at more than two times its GMV. But GMV is not sales or revenue to Flipkart; it is total sales of online products.</p><p>Another reason for the flood of investment into India is the fear of missing out — or FOMO.</p><p>Flipkart likely takes a nominal revenue share or take rate like Amazon does, but they also must shoulder significant user acquisition costs, meaning they are losing money on every transaction for the foreseeable future. Granted, this is not unlike Amazon’s past strategy, but Amazon was never valued at equal to the entire market’s value either. Add on the fact that approximately 40 percent of the market is non-travel and you have to wonder how these numbers add up. It is no surprise that Flipkart saw its valuation marked down by almost a quarter by three fund investors.</p><p>Another reason for the flood of investment into India is the fear of missing out — or FOMO — on something akin to China’s enormous success. In one camp, you have investors Napster and Softbank whose portfolios include very successful bets in the Chinese and Indian markets (JD.com, Tencent and Flipkart for Napster, and Alibaba and Snapdeal for Softbank). In the other camp, you have the investors like Amazon who misfired on Chinese growth and do not want to repeat past mistakes. Beyond that, there are local and international VC firms like Sequoia and Accel, as well as more opportunistic investors like Tiger Global that sense opportunity and do not want to be left out.</p><p>So what does this mean for the other unicorns in India? Investment in Indian startups decreased in the first half of 2016 to $2.1 billion, a 40 percent decline from the same period in 2015, when startups raised $3.5 billion. Anecdotally, it seems as though this retrenchment is not due to a reassessment of the startups in question but is part of a global reassessment of investor appetite for tech startups worldwide. It is likely that market leaders like Flipkart, Ola and others will get devalued markedly, but will continue to receive investor interest due to FOMO.</p><p>Naspers' PayU buys Citrus Pay for $130M in cash to expand in India</p><p>Marketing and optimization startup Zarget raises $6M</p><p>Houzz comes to India</p><p>This Indian team plans to be the first private company to land on the moon</p><p>This does not portend well for the rest of Indian startups </p>",

The I-PACE looks like a sensible small utility vehicle, with a five-door design and performance-tuned features including a target 0-60mph time of “around” four seconds, a 310+ mile range and a 50kW DC charging mechanism that helps it reclaim 80 percent of its total range capability from zero in just 90 minutes.</p><p>The I-PACE looks similar in dimensions to the Tesla Model X, with a broad rear-end designed for max boot space tapering to a slim and sleek rounded front. The idea was to make a car designed for sport-loving drivers, with a low, road-hugging cockpit and yet with tons of usable space for those in the family way.</p><p>I don’t understand why car companies can’t name their all-electric concepts without invoking all-caps, dashes or isolated letters, but the I-PACE does look like an intriguing machines, especially if it actually makes it to production in 2018. Besides the exterior design, which I think succeeds in being attractive as well as properly engineered for electric efficiency, I also like the cockpit concept, which uses two large touch screens combines with a digital instrument cluster display to create what Jaguar called a “flightdeck” for the driver.</p><p>The full length glass roof is also signature futuristic indulgence, which is not to say it’s unwelcome, but ultimately it’s a mighty nice looking vehicle in large part because it’s such a departure from Jaguar’s existing lineup in terms of design language.</p><p>Concept cars are still only that, of course, and a lot can happen between conception and production, but Jaguar definitely looks to be rolling in the right direction with its all-electric debut.</p>",

These include Quora co-founder and chief executive officer Adam D’Angelo; Automattic founder and CEO Matt Mullenweg (who is also a co-founder of WordPress); Dropbox vice president of engineering Aditya Agarwal; and Ruchi Sanghvi, the former vice president of operations at Dropbox.</p><p>Each made undisclosed personal investments and will serve as advisors to Hike as it attempts to gain more traction. Hike’s main competitor is Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which claims 900 million users around the world and India, where one study found that more than half of Internet users log onto the messaging app every day, is its biggest market.</p><p>Hike has been holding its own since it launched in December 2012, however, and now claims 70 million users, with over a billion messages sent each day.</p><p>In a statement, Mullenweg said “As an online social media entrepreneur myself, I have keenly observed India. I believe in Hike Messenger’s vision and I can see the team gearing up and are well positioned for aggressive growth in the country.”</p><p>One of Hike’s advantages is tailoring its services to people who are going online for the first time, founder and chief executive officer Kavin Bharti Mittal told TechCrunch. WhatsApp is expected to add video calls soon, which may make it even more difficult to compete with (both services already have voice calling), but Hike’s goal is to create a simple messaging app (which is useful for people on limited data plans or in areas with poor connections), but that still offers the same wide variety of services as other Asian messaging apps like WeChat and Line.</p><p>“Specifically, for those people just coming onto the Internet, Hike’s a true platform and one gets far more than just messaging and photo sharing. People have easy access to real-time news, live cricket scores, coupons from their favorite brands, and much, much more,” he says.</p><p>The company plans to work with its new investor/advisors to grow its user base.</p><p>“They’ve seen immense scale and have launched and been involved in products that scale across the globe over hundreds of millions of users,” says Mittal. “Very few people have seen such scale, and access to that knowledge and those insights will be extremely useful in scaling up the company.”</p>",

But companies are still adapting and figuring out what matters most to this large demographic and employee base.</p><p>Now, a tech startup called Zugata has raised $7 million in Series A venture funding to replace the crusty old performance review with something more motivating to this group than a twice-a-year, managerial write-up.</p><p>Investors in Zugata’s new round included Canaan Partners, General Catalyst and Redpoint Ventures.</p><p>Founded in 2014, Palo Alto-based Zugata developed software as a service that automatically figures out who employees work with most, and then helps them gather feedback from each other, directly, without managers or HR departments eavesdropping.</p><p>Companies that use Zugata can set a policy so that employees may exchange feedback either anonymously, or with their names attached.</p><p>Zugata shows users a set of skills that a colleague should have mastered, based on their functional role. For each skill, a user marks it as strength or not yet a strength.</p><p>The employer cannot access messages exchanged, not through their HR department, IT or any other division. If court orders (or some other situation) required messages between employees to be disclosed such requests would be handled by Zugata.</p><p>Zugata CEO and cofounder Srinivas Krishnamurti explained that providing employees with a private, but official, means of exchanging feedback decouples professional development and performance goal-setting from salary and promotion decisions.</p><p>Krishanmurti said the effect is beneficial for a few reasons. “Feedback that employees get is only visible to them. Managers, others do not see it. So if I have a problem with what you are doing, you get feedback from me, but your boss cannot see it and in effect, I don’t rat on you to HR or your boss,” he explained.</p><p>Ultimately, Zugata should help employees understand where their own perceived strengths and weaknesses lie, he said, and how to improve their work and careers.</p><p>Many HR Tech players, from startups like Glint, Impraise or Namely to larger players like PeopleSoft or Cornerstone On Demand, have tried to redefine performance reviews. Key features feel like a survey that’s run throughout the year, or systems that allow employees to give kudos to one another.</p><p>Zugata considers its approach distinct in the field of HR tech, and what’s called “performance management” in the trade.</p><p>To ascertain which employees should give feedback to which other employees, and to deliver “learning modules” that address areas for improvement with some educational content, Zugata uses artificial intelligence and machine learning, and plugs into email and collaboration tools like Gmail, Outlook, Slack, Github and Gira.</p><p>Canaan Partners General Partner Hrach Simonian said, “The paradigm shift from annual to continuous feedback is talked about by a lot of companies. But most of the big platforms are really gimmicky. Zugata is providing an objective system that helps you score skills and set goals instead of just collecting badges. And it’s gaining traction in what amounts to a huge market.”</p><p>Primarily, the company plans to use the Series A capital for hiring, product development, international expansion, and to help its clients deliver corporate learning to their employees that is perfectly tailored to their needs.</p>",

In the end, entering that information takes sales people away from their livelihood and there was little upside for them to do this.</p><p>What Einstein aims to do is flip that model, so instead of spending a lot of time entering information, the system is going to do a lot of that work for them, and because it’s intelligent, it will provide meaningful suggestions about what to do next.</p><p>“AI can surface the most important information to the top and say, ‘hey, this is what you need to do next’, so the sales person can do what they do best, which is connecting with the customer, and not spend so much time entering data,” Shubha Nabar, director of data science at Salesforce explained.</p><p>The question becomes why is AI taking center stage now for Salesforce and much of the software industry in general. Richard Socher, chief scientist at Salesforce (who came over when the company bought MetaMind last spring) says it’s a perfect convergence of technology and compute power coming together at the right time.</p><p>“AI has become really useful due to a number of small improvements on the algorithmic side, having the data, and having the infrastructure and compute to really do it,” Socher said.</p><p>It’s easy to think of AI as replacing humans, but sales people are a perfect example of how computers and software can augment what humans do well — in this case, interact with other humans to sell them stuff.</p><p>While we may be in the earliest days of artificial intelligence, we should start to see the technology mature over the next 5 or 10 years, and for Salesforce users, that could mean working smarter and faster and knowing the best move to make next.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sauce Labs, a cloud-based software testing service, announced a $70 million round today. The investment is more than double the $31 million the company had raised across four previous rounds and brings the total investment to $101 million.</p><p>Centerview Capital Technology, IVP, and Adams Street Partners all participated. Under the terms of the deal, Buno Pati, partner at Centerview and Sandy Miller, general partner at IVP, will join the Sauce Labs Board of Directors.</p><p>Sauce Labs has been around since 2008, but CEO Charles Ramsey says in some ways the company was offering an automated approach to software testing before the broad market was ready for it. Back in the dark ages of 2008, many companies were still using the Waterfall approach to development. It was a deliberate methodology in which you finished one release before you started the next. In that world, testing was done manually by a QA department who checked each feature to make sure it worked across a number of devices and browsers.</p><p>“What we provide essentially is infrastructure as a service and software that allows developers to write their own tests and to manage the [testing] process,” Ramsey explained. Once the script is written, it can automatically test across whatever devices, browsers and operating systems the developer chooses.</p><p>As we’ve moved forward, the world has changed and moved more toward Sauce Labs’ automated approach. Companies have embraced Agile development methodology, which is more of a continuous development approach than a defined one. When you combine this with a growing number of devices, operating systems and browsers (and a legacy history to support), the idea that you could manually test against all of these contingencies became much more challenging. As companies moved to Agile, they couldn’t have testing be the bottleneck.</p><p>In essence, the market has caught up with Sauce Labs, Ramsey explained, and they believe they are poised to take off, being a company in the right place with the right product at the right time. Apparently their investors saw it that way too because they wrote an enormous check to give them the cash to take the company to the next level.</p><p>The company currently has 3500 customers and 140 employees. With this influx of money, they plan to hire engineers, sales people and customer success personnel over the next year, which should allow them to take advantage of the growing demand in a more controlled fashion.</p><p>As for why the company took so long to get to this point, Ramsey says things always move more slowly in the wider industry than we think. There is a tendency among technologists to think everyone is moving en masse to the next big thing, whether that’s the cloud, mobile or Agile development. Large companies tend to be more cautious than that (or at least they have been until recently).</p><p>Companies are recognizing that to be competitive, they have to update their development methodologies, and when they do, Sauce Labs now has $70 million to help convince them to move to their testing products.</p>",

    "content": "<p>It’s true, Facebook isn’t single-handedly responsible for the outcome of the U. S. presidential election. But the company played an important part in the rise of Donald Trump. Many people now think Facebook has to find a way to flag fake news appropriately before the next election in 2020. But it’s a much more urgent issue.</p><p>Facebook has to weed out fake news before the Dutch, French, Kenyan, Chilean, and many, many other elections in 2017. These elections could see populist candidates triumph once again.</p><p>The company shouldn’t just question its responsibility when there’s an election in the U. S. Given Facebook’s penetration rate around the world, Facebook is now in charge of propagating news in most countries.</p><p>I’m tired of seeing Facebook burying its head in the sand on this issue. Instead of issuing multiple half-hearted statements saying that “everything is fine,” Facebook should be open and transparent about this issue.</p><p>It doesn’t matter if Facebook thinks that everything is fine and well. Millions of people now think that Facebook could do a better job when it comes to news articles in the news feed. So the company should work on it. It seems like a reasonable thing to ask as this is exactly what technology companies are supposed to do. They iterate, improve their products over time and add new features.</p><p>But the worst part is that Facebook’s incentive aren’t directly aligned with everyone’s incentive. Fake news articles spread like a virus. They create a lot of engagement. They improve the number of daily active users, which leads to more ad engagement, which leads to better quarterly earnings.</p><p>And yet, it doesn’t matter if Facebook’s quarter is awesome thanks to the presidential election if the company becomes irrelevant in five years. Facebook has to act now to protect its long-term reputation.</p><p>Even more important, I’d even say that this issue could greatly damage the economy in many countries, which could have indirect effects on the company’s bottom line. Facebook tends to boost the so-called anti-establishment candidates. Many of them are just populists who want to destroy existing policies in favor of alternative policies that exclude immigrants, minorities and demolish the welfare state. Dividing people into groups and pitting them against each other will never lead to systemic economic growth.</p><p>And because of Facebook’s algorithm, populist candidates with a vocal fanbase can use Facebook as a megaphone to convert new people. It doesn’t matter if something is true or false. Many people are now looking for articles that will validate their views and share them ad nauseam. That’s why it’s important to fix the megaphone.</p><p>“But free speech!” you might say. Facebook isn’t a balanced platform in the first place. You choose your friends on Facebook, and they tend to validate your opinion. After Trump’s election, many of my friends told me something along the lines of “I thought my liberal bubble was bigger than it actually is and I blame Facebook.” How many people did you unfriend because they shared some nonsensical article about Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?</p><p>Given that most people share articles without even reading these articles in the first place, Facebook should at least flag articles when they’re fake so that people know what they’re dealing with.</p><p>I’m not saying that Facebook should stop you from posting all sorts of articles. People should be able to share cute kitten videos as well as conspiracy theories. But if people don’t even click on the links before sharing them, Facebook should put a question mark and say “you should think twice before sharing this.” That’s the least the company can do.</p><p>This issue isn’t just affecting Facebook. It turns out that Facebook is the bigger player in this space, so the focus is on Facebook right now. But Twitter, Google search results, YouTube and all social networks should take a minute and think about what they’re going to do over the next few months to fix their platforms.</p><p>I can’t help but feel a sense of urgency around Facebook’s plague of fake news. If Facebook can’t fix its platform, France will end up with Marine Le Pen. In other words, no, Facebook, it’s not time to issue 18 different statements saying that sure, maybe one day Facebook will consider thinking about someday drafting a new feature that will reduce the reach of fake news. It’s time to act now before all world leaders are demagogues.</p><p>It all comes down to a simple question — is Facebook a technology company or a media company? When the company fired its human editors for Trending Topics, Facebook made a clear choice in favor of algorithms.</p><p>But by putting the algorithms in charge, Facebook unintentionally made an editorial decision. Facebook doesn’t get to decide if it is a media company or not. It gets to set its own editorial rules and enforce them using a combination of algorithms and humans.</p>",

    "content": "<p>In case you missed it, last night Mark Zuckerberg published a response to accusations that “fake news” on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U. S. election, and helped Donald Trump to win.</p><p>The CEO claimed that at least 99% of news content on Facebook was “authentic.” Zuckerberg wrote:</p><p>“Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.”</p><p>Facebook boasts 1.79 monthly active users, and it generated $7.01 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2016.</p><p>The company has not enumerated the volume of posts that were categorized as news, and distributed through Facebook’s News Feed during the months leading up to the election.</p><p>In its earnings reports, Facebook does not break out how much of its revenue comes from political advertising or the promotion of news posts. That makes it hard for the public to evaluate what the impact of even 1% of “hoax” news could have been on users of Facebook who had the right to vote in the U. S. election.</p><p>Questions remain as to whether hoaxes could have been so well-targeted that they did, in fact, sway opinions of U. S. voters on candidates and issues.</p><p>We know that Facebook has the power to influence emotions and has tested its own abilities in this regard through its 2012 Emotion Manipulation Experiment.</p><p>As TechCrunch reported when news of that experiment first broke, to impact users’ moods, Facebook showed them less positive posts in their News Feed. As a result, users included .1% fewer positive words in their own posts, Facebook found.</p><p>Last night, Zuckerberg emphasized that Facebook currently relies on the wisdom and involvement of its users to “flag hoaxes and fake news.” He admitted the company could do more to improve the quality of information shared via its News Feed.</p><p>However, he also warned the company would not rush to release new solutions around factchecking or quality-rating news content on the platform.</p><p>“This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully though. Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual. I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.”</p><p>Zuckerberg’s comment draws a false equivalency between “mainstream sources” of news (including TechCrunch) and political groups masquerading as news brands.</p><p>The Denver Guardian was one site that posed as a news publisher to bombarded readers with content full of misinformation meant to sway their opinions about candidates and issues on the ballot. And another group, based in Macedonia, had been posting fake news to Facebook’s News Feed simply to make money.</p><p>Fake news circulated virtually everywhere online, and on Facebook, at a time when voters needed facts to inform their decisions, unfortunately.</p><p>There is a possibility that Facebook may not even want to become “arbiters of truth,” because doing so could reduce engagement.</p><p>As a former Facebook designer named Bobby Goodlatte wrote on November 8th on his own Facebook wall, “Sadly, News Feed optimizes for engagement. As we’ve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging.”</p><p>Other social media players under fire for helping to spread false stories ahead of the U. S. election include Twitter, Reddit, and others.</p><p>But unlike other social networks, Facebook can proudly claim that it helped 2 million people register to vote in this most recent election. What good is that if those voters aren’t effectively informed, though?</p>",

    "content": "<p>Fans of cross-platform coding will be happy to know that Visual Studio, “a true mobile-first, cloud-first development tool for .NET and C#,” will arrive for Mac during the Connect() conference in November. The move places Microsoft’s IDE on Macs. The IDE follows Visual Studio Code, Microsoft’s code editor, to OS X.</p><p>Why is Microsoft seemingly abandoning the quest for Windows hegemony? The writing is on the wall: cloud computing is the future and tools like AWS and Azure are quickly replacing the local server. Microsoft is losing out to tools like Docker and Heroku on the web and it’s only a matter of time before coders are more comfortable with their MacBooks and VIM than with Windows.</p><p>“They make their money off Azure and other services. In other words, they are making their money mainly off of developers now and its in their best interest to get on the good side of devs which is why they suddenly have a vested interest in open sourcing tools and helping Mac/Linux,” wrote Hacker News user BoysenberryPi.</p><p>The IDE is very similar to the one found on Windows. In fact, that is presumably the point. By making it easy for OS X users to switch back and forth between platforms Microsoft is able ensure coders can quickly become desktop agnostic or, barring that, give Windows a try again. From the release:</p><p>￼At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor.</p><p>You can read more about the platform here and prepare yourself for a little C# coding with Visual Studio Code.</p>",

This is not true of the rival HTC Vive headset, which earlier this month increased in price by £70, with the company blaming “recent currency valuation changes”.</p><p>The Vive’s post-Brexit UK price is £759 which on the surface makes the Oculus look a whole lot more competitive (at £549), although in reality it’s not a like-for-like comparison because the Rift is not yet shipping with its dedicated Touch motion controllers.</p><p>The Touch controllers have been delayed until later this year and Oculus has said they will also cost more — how much more we don’t yet know. Whereas the Vive’s price is the all-in kit cost (although as with both headsets you still need to own or buy a powerful enough PC to drive the VR). So it remains to be seen whether the Oculus will be a more or less affordable full VR rig than the HTC Vive.</p><p>How much demand there is for virtual reality remains an unknown at this nascent stage. But reporting its Q2 quarterly results earlier this month, HTC credited the Vive headset with contributing to a 27 per cent rise in its revenues over the prior quarter. Although it did not break out any hard sales data. Oculus has also kept quiet on Rift sales to date.</p><p>Even without any sales data it’s clear that a rich ecosystem of compelling content is going to be essential if VR is to be anything other than an expensive and niche gaming playground for the few. And that will certainly take time to develop.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Billionaire investor Peter Thiel may have been trying to drum up more support for Republican candidate Donald Trump this morning at the National Press Club in Washington. But a 15-minute long speech he delivered sounded more like a plea to Americans to understand what’s so wrong with this country, rather than a case for Trump. His pitch: American is broken, and there’s nothing crazy about supporting change — despite Trump.</p><p>He didn’t talk about Trump’s intellect, his command of the issues, or his suitability for the office of president.</p><p>Instead, Thiel spoke at length about the condition of the U. S., citing a litany of statistics mean to alarm: 64 percent of people age 55 in the U.S have less than a year’s worth of savings. Healthcare costs are “10 times” the cost of “simple medicines” anywhere else in the world. College tuition has risen faster than the rate of inflation. Millennials expect their lives to be worse than the lives of their parents. Incomes are stagnant, with the median household making less money today than 17 years ago. The government is “wasting trillions of dollars of taxpayer money” on foreign wars in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, and Somalia.</p><p>Trump, argued Thiel, is a vote against the status quo, even while Thiel offered nary a detail about how Trump would address any of these issues.</p><p>In many ways, follow-up questions that followed Thiel’s presentation were more interesting than the speech itself.</p><p>Asked about Trump’s vulgar, decade-old comments about women that aired earlier this month, Thiel said they were in “extremely poor taste” and “extremely inappropriate” but he argued that Trump wouldn’t make the same comments today.</p><p>Asked about his recent,  widely reported $1.25 million donation to Trump’s campaign, Thiel said he “didn’t think about it as much as I should have.” He noted that neither candidate’s campaign has been hugely successful on the fundraising front, adding that Trump specifically hasn’t raised much, so “I didn’t think he needed the money, and I hadn’t donated.”</p><p>When the campaign finally asked him for help — apparently after it became clear that none was forthcoming — “I thought I’d go ahead and write a check,” Thiel said.</p><p>Thiel was also asked about Trump’s personality traits and whether he is concerned about his temperament. Thiel mostly dodged the question, saying instead that when it comes to president, he’s more concerned with world view than temperament, and that he’s more worried about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, saying he thinks she has the propensity to get the U. S. into “more wars.”</p><p>Asked about other government regulations, including around small businesses, Thiel said he thinks Trump “viscerally” understands them.</p><p>What about Trump’s track record as a businessman? He has a “huge number of zeros” in his net worth, said Thiel.</p><p>Pressed on what he thinks of Trump’s four (or more) bankruptcies, Thiel said he suspects that “real estate is very different than tech. It’s a fairly zero sum business — a very tough industry especially in big cities like Manhattan or San Francisco. I suspect in many ways what [Trump] did was par for the course in that context.”</p><p>What about the tax returns that Trump has refused to admit? Here, Thiel suggested that government focuses too much on transparency, suggesting that it’s why we “in some ways have a less talented group running [for office] than 30 or 40 years ago.”</p><p>Not last, Thiel was asked about Trump’s oft-repeated statements about banning Muslims from traveling to the United States.</p><p>Somewhat amazingly, Thiel — who said he doesn’t support a “religious test”  — said the “media is always taking him literally. I think a lot of the voters take him seriously but not literally, so when they hear the Muslim comment or the wall comment, it’s not, ‘Are you going to build a wall like the Great Wall of China but, ‘We’re going to have a saner, more sensible immigration policy’ and ‘How do we strike the right balance between costs and benefits?'”</p><p>Um. Here’s Trump talking about the “impenetrable, physical” wall he wants to build in a campaign speech last month.</p><p>Thiel acknowledged that he has “gotten pushback” owing to his support for Trump. He said that his “close working relationships remain intact,” however, and that his very public stance hasn’t impacted his businesses as far as he is aware.</p><p>He also said that he isn’t interested in a full-time role in politics.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Artificial intelligence has become more of a philosophy than a programming tool at Facebook. Laced across the company’s products, it holds the power to analyze data at the massive scale required by a social network connecting a quarter of the world’s population.</p><p>In a speech today at Web Summit, Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer laid out a vision for the role artificial intelligence and machine learning will play in the company’s ambitions to improve global connectivity, technology accessibility, and human computer interaction.</p><p>“People want to stay connected and close to other people, so whatever is the best current technology to deploy that is the business we want to be in,” said Schroepfer.</p><p>Large companies like Facebook play an incredibly important role in the artificial intelligence and machine learning ecosystem. Their sheer size and ability to corner the market on talent makes almost every strategic decision they make an industry-wide declaration.</p><p>Despite setbacks, like the explosion of Facebook’s satellite aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 earlier this summer, the company remains steadfast in its goals to better connect the world. It is pursuing a number of infrastructure projects, made possible by machine intelligence, aimed at augmenting both urban and suburban internet connectivity.</p><p>Project Aquila, which has been well documented, is designed to bring connectivity to suburban areas. The carbon fiber, solar-powered planes fly in a constellation at altitudes higher than a commercial airliner. The planes remain in communication with each other via laser and communicate with the ground via radio frequency. Facebook is using trained neural networks to identify population centers across rural Africa that could be targeted by the planes so the company reaches the maximum number of people with internet access.</p><p>For urban connectivity, Facebook is using LiDAR, the same technology behind many self-driving car projects, to map out utility polls. Identifying the location of these polls is critical to optimizing connectivity. Teams at the company are building virtual network graphs on top of the data to create the best data mesh.</p><p>For consumers, the easiest way to visually interact with Facebook’s ML work is through Style Transfer. Built on top of a new mobile deep-learning platform called Caffe2Go, the feature lets users capture artistically stylized video footage in real-time. Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer, previously demoed the technology at WSJDLive — showing the audience how they can make their own content look like it was created by Van Gogh himself.</p><p>When engineers first began to build Style Transfer, the best they could do with the computational resources of a smartphone was to stylize a small frame within a full-frame video. After a year of tinkering, the version we got to see not only altered the entire frame in real time, but didn’t display any noticeable signs of lag. Originally popularized by the app Prisma, Style Transfer filters are set to be integrated into the Facebook app soon and are already being tested in a few countries.</p><p>Caffe2Go won’t remain limited to Style Transfer — it holds the key to deploying convolutional neural nets across Facebook’s suite of mobile apps.</p><p>“For anything we build on the server, we now have a vehicle to ship it to mobile devices,” noted Schroepfer.</p><p>Bringing machine intelligence to the smartphone is just step one. For the time being, the world still doesn’t have an answer for training neural networks on mobile devices. The prospect coupled with Facebook’s long-term roadmap make a compelling argument for a future where the average person could design and train a custom neural net on their own smartphone for daily use.</p><p>Using today’s cutting edge technology, researchers still had to generate hundreds of artistic stylizations and painstakingly home in on attributes to deliver the best possible Style Transfer experience. With continued research, Facebook hopes to someday leverage our own facial expressions to give us another way to interact with its technology.</p><p>Near term, this could manifest itself as a “surprise” filter being laid over a selfie taken, triggered by opening our eyes wide or opening our mouths, similar to some of Snapchat’s animated selfie lenses. But improvements in facial tracking could someday let use seamlessly share our emotional state with the technologies around us — perhaps most interestingly while in virtual reality. Facebook has already invented VR emoji, which turn gestures into facial expressions on your VR avatar. Shake your fist, and your avatar’s face appears angry, or turn up your palms to adopt a look of confusion.</p><p>Facebook’s forays into virtual reality and its potential to put us in the same room with our loved ones on the other side of the world require a shift in how we understand the company. Schroepfer explains “It really is less about Facebook the mobile app today, and more about Facebook—the mission of using technology to connect people.”</p><p>Of course, all of this becomes more interesting once corded VR is no more. Right now, Facebook’s two form-factors for VR are the technologically limited mobile headsets with a phone strapped inside, and the more immersive but clumsy tethered headsets restricted to home use with positional tracking cameras.</p><p>The next set of VR problems will require leaps forward in computer vision. Facebook has already rolled out new stabilization technology for 360 videos, but there is more to be done. Related technologies like inside-out tracking and speech recognition will also improve the realism of VR experiences. Facebook’s Oculus division is now building a standalone mobile VR rig, pushing to combine the freedom of phone-based portable VR and the power of a headset strapped to a computer.</p><p>“We have talked about doing things in the long term in augmented reality,” added Schroepfer. “We would absolutely build devices for it because I think that will be a way you will communicate with</p>",

The company that brought you a pair of watches called the Jewel and Elegant has teamed with Porsche Design to give the world a really expensive version of its new flagship.</p><p>The limited edition device harkens back to a time when nearly every smartphone had some ultra luxury equivalent. And while the Porsche Design Mate 9 isn’t encrusted in gold or jewels, it’s certainly got the pricing bit down at €1395 ($1,533) in Europe.</p><p>Need convincing that you need to spend that much on a smartphone? We’ll defer to the language in the device’s announcement for this one,</p><p>Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9 features seamless curved edges, a graphite finish and stylish black coloring combined with the latest technology. This is perfectly complemented ‘under the hood’ by a unique, intuitive user interface that exudes sophistication thanks to Porsche Design’s signature design language. With a shared commitment to functional design, innovative craftsmanship and cutting-edge technology, the collaboration delivers highly discerning customers an unrivaled, premium smartphone experience; with revolutionary speed, extensive battery life and luxurious design cues.</p><p>Now if that doesn’t make you want to spend $1,533 on a phone, I don’t know what will. Design language aside, the handset features a few improvement over the standard Mate 9, including 256GB of storage and 6GB of RAM (vs. 64 and 4). The same camera and massive 4,000mAh battery are still on board here, though, weirdly, the screen has been shrunk from 5.9 to 5.5 inches – though you still get a higher resolution at 2560 x 1440 (vs. 1920 x 1080).</p><p>It’ll be available in January through Porsche Design Stores pretty much everywhere but the US.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Facebook Messenger is preparing to launch a new “Instant Games” platform that will let people  play lightweight games against friends. Candy Crush maker King.com is already testing one of these Instant Games called “Shuffle Cats Mini” in New Zealand, TechCrunch has discovered. And other studios including Big Viking also appear to be prepping for the Instant Games launch.</p><p>Facebook has been largely shut out of the native mobile gaming world by Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. But by building games into Messenger by using it as a portal to mobile web apps, Facebook could create a new platform that drives Messenger engagement. Users could come to Messenger to play Instant Games, challenge friends via Facebook Messages, and potentially earn Facebook a cut of in-game purchases. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Earlier today, The Information reported that Facebook is building the Instant Games platform for asynchronous games that you can take turns playing with friends, not necessarily at the same time. Instant Games expands on the success of the chess, basketball, and soccer mini-games Facebook itself built for Messenger earlier this year by allowing third-party developers to build them too. Facebook plans to release a development kit or tool later this month, though developers haven’t been told if they’ll be able to charge for in-game purchases.</p><p>The Information wrote that Facebook is already privately testing Instant Games, though it didn’t name any studios. TechCrunch has discovered casual gaming giant King.com already has a Facebook Page for its Shuffle Cats Mini game that it refers to as “a slick card-flicking Instant Game from King”.</p><p>The Page is actively allowing users in certain regions like New Zealand to play, but those in the US get an error message when they try to load it on mobile. Shuffle Cats Mini seems to partially load on the web, revealing a game where you fling cards at targets in a little shooting gallery, but you can’t finish a game or share your score to compete with friends — which would mirror how Messenger’s basketball and soccer games worked.</p><p>After some more digging, we found that earlier this week, a startup called Big Viking announced it’d raised over $21 million to build “HTML5 instant games”, according to VentureBeat.</p><p>When I asked Big Viking CEO Albert Lai today about the company’s plans, he told me “HTML5 is a technology that basically allows us to embed our games into anything and everything as well as inside messenger platforms with bots. In any messenger platform, [people] can play our game. This completely shifts the power in the distribution system. Anywhere there’s a messenger we can deliver our games instantaneously.”</p><p>Yet when I asked if that meant Big Viking’s title could be Facebook Instant Games, he suddenly got cagey and told me “I can’t speak to anything related to what we may or may not be doing on Facebook.” That makes it sound like Facebook forbid him from discussing it.</p><p>On Big Viking’s site, you can play a preview of Galatron VS, a vertically-scrolling arcade spaceship shooter game with a messaging twist. You receive in-game challenges like trying to score 10,000 points via messages from a computer-controlled character.</p><p>The game is already available via messaging app Kik’s game store. There, you chat with a bot who recruits you to “Galatron Space Academy”. After some banter, you’re given a link to play the HTML5 game. You can compete in tournaments that display the ‘ghosts’ of other players alongside your spaceship as you play. This fits with the idea of Instant Games being asynchronous. Your friend on Facebook Messenger could perhaps play, then challenge you, and you’d see the echo of their run as you play yours.</p><p>Galatron looks especially impressive for an HTML5 game, with sharp graphics and responsive controls. It shows that HTML5 may have finally matured to the point that the mobile web standard is worthy of competing with native mobile games.</p><p>Once upon a time circa 2009, Facebook built a massively popular gaming platform on its desktop site in partnership with developers like Zynga and EA. But as users shifted to mobile, Facebook’s games couldn’t follow. iOS and Android became the home for mobile and social gaming, and Facebook stopped earning its 30% taxes on in-game purchases.</p><p>In 2011, Facebook tried to launch an HTML5 gaming platform codenamed Project Spartan. The problem was that they HTML5 standard was still weak and developers hadn’t figured out how to push its performance limits. Studios weren’t able to make games that stood up against native iOS and Android games, and the platform quickly flopped and was scrapped.</p><p>At the end of its desktop era in Q4 2012, Facebook earned $256 million in payments, largely from games, off its 1.06 billion users. Since then, Facebook has grown to 1.79 billion users, yet payment revenue has declined to $196 million.</p><p>But now Facebook is making another big push into gaming. This week it officially announced Facebook Gameroom, a desktop PC gaming platform similar to Steam but more focused on casual gaming. Meanwhile it’s preparing a mobile assault.</p><p>Instant Games is the culmination of years of groundwork. Facebook launched the Messenger platform for content and utility apps in April 2015, and one legitimate game called Doodle Draw appeared but never grew popular. Then this April Messenger launched its bot platform. Both were designed to allow users to do more than just chat inside the app, from calling an Uber or editing photos to receiving news and shopping.</p><p>Gaming could expand Messenger’s capabilities while naturally leveraging Facebook’s social graph. Compared to deeper native mobile games, the beauty of lightweight HTML5 games like Shuffle Cats Mini or Galatron VS is that you don’t need much instruction or experience and can play during short breaks in your day. That makes them convenient, accessible to the mainstream, and viral.</p><p>What these lightweight games l</p>",

    "content": "<p>Having followed the election goodness of Cognovi Labs for the last couple of months, it is interesting to see the startup spring into action as this unprecedented election season has unfolded upon us. The Dayton, Ohio startup—which is also part of the IKOVE Venture Partners “Startup Nursery”—uses a combination of human and machine learning to interpret Twitter traffic in a way that it can predict not only sentiment, but also quantify a range of emotional reactions whole regions of the world are collectively feeling. The startup is following a host of election results today and will be publishing the results on their Twitter feed this afternoon.</p><p>According to the company, this emotional analysis has been useful to understanding people’s emotional reactions to events or happenings and the predictive nature of it has many potential uses (financial markets, news gathering and elections all come to mind here). For example, the startup successfully used their near-real-time tool, called Twitris, to successfully predict the Brexit vote hours earlier than traditional polling companies.</p><p>As the company analyzed the three presidential debates this year, their research scored the emotional reaction of the U. S. population confirming that neither candidate are necessarily well liked (not a big surprise). Twitris offers an interesting way to understand and quantify something nebulous like a debate which doesn’t necessarily have a distinct winner or loser.</p><p>But Twitris can gather regular old sentiment as well and in speaking with founder Dr. Amit Sheth and CEO James Mainord this week, the company are seeing some interesting sentiment-based insights.</p><p>Ahead of election day, Cognovi Labs were identifying presidential candidate sentiment and volume distribution leaning toward Clinton on November 5 – 6 (controlled for tweets identified and located in the battleground state of Florida (346,837 tweets) normalized to account for bots, RT, and other distortions). Though 60% of the tweets were about Trump, he trailed Clinton in sentiment throughout the duration of the weekend with the latter averaging 52.7% and the former at 47.3% (Hourly Standard Deviation noted in error bar)</p><p>Essentially the company’s tool was showing that, based on sentiment discussed digitally on Twitter, that Clinton is leading in the must-win state of Florida and hence, possibly the election as a result.</p><p>On Monday the company was tracking that if Trump wins Florida then he has a possible path to 270 electoral votes. If he loses Florida then there Clinton’s victory is largely inevitable. This analysis will highlight findings from Nov. 5-6 leading into the final two days, looking at multiple statewide indicators to gauge how Florida will move.</p><p>The startup is following many other down-ballot election contests on their Twitter feed today too and it’s interesting to follow along. If any big upsets are predicted, I’ll update the post today.</p>",

    "content": "<p>GE Digital today announced that it has acquired Wise.io, a machine-learning powered service that helps businesses find patterns and trends in their vast data stores. At first glance, that may seem like an odd acquisition for a company like GE. It’s important to keep in mind, though, that with Predix, GE already offers its customers a service that focuses on helping them monitor their equipment, whether that’s an industrial tool or an aircraft engine, and predict issues based on the monitoring data.</p><p>As GE CIO Jim Fowler told me, the company’s developers wrote a few hundred different models for lots of different assets in Predix. The service has some rudimentary AI capabilities, but the addition of Wise.io’s technology — which can find patterns on its own — and its team will allow GE to offer a far more flexible model. “As we think about services going forward, you’ll see GE enter verticals we haven’t been in before,” Fowler told me.</p><p>In many ways, GE itself is undergoing the kind of digital transformation that many of its own customers are dealing with. It’s undergoing what Fowler called a “new industrial revolution,” where it has to reposition itself to play in the field of analytics, data, machine learning, etc. To keep pace, the company has been making a number of acquisitions. These include the purchase of ServiceMax for almost $1 billion yesterday and Wise.io today (as well as the rather quiet acquisition of data integration platform Bit Stew earlier this year).</p><p>GE and Wise.io did not disclose the acquisition price. Wise.io previously raised $3.58 million. The company also participated in the Alchemist Accelerator and Citrix Startup Accelerator programs.</p><p>Wise.io will continue to operate as usual and GE will continue to service its existing customers. While the company is mostly buying Wise.io for its technology and talent, this also means it’s getting access to quite a few Wise.io customers who probably never considered GE as a vendor. Wise.io’s users currently include the likes of Pinterest, Twilio, Thumbtack and Republic Wireless.</p><p>GE expects that software will bring in $15 billion in revenue by 2020 (I wonder if it used Predix to set that number…). The vast majority of this ($10 billion) will likely come from existing customers, $1 billion will come from the efficiencies it hopes to gain by driving internal usage of technologies like Wise.io and it expects that $4 billion will come from new customers.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Yesterday, former Fortune reporter Dan Primack reported that not only was billionaire investor Peter Thiel being considered for Donald Trump’s transition team but that Thiel was, in fact, already on it as of yesterday.</p><p>That report has since been confirmed. Now, a newer report from Primack — a tweet, actually — states that Trump’s transition team is “looking at” Rex Tibbens, the COO of the ride-share company Lyft, as a potential candidate for U. S. Transportation Secretary.</p><p>Asked earlier today about the claim, a Lyft spokesperson said Tibbens would “be a valuable asset to any organization, but he is not interested in pursuing a role outside of Lyft.”</p><p>A source close to Tibbens separately says that Tibbens hasn’t had any conversations with anyone in Trump’s camp.</p><p>That doesn’t rule out possible interest by the transition team, however.</p><p>Certainly, such an appointment is interesting to noodle. Tibbens would represent the worst kind of crony capitalism, of course. Founders Fund — the venture fund co-founded a decade ago by Thiel — is a shareholder in Lyft, having led the company’s $15 million Series B round in 2013. Thiel has been among the company’s most vocal proponents, in fact. At a TechCrunch Disrupt event in 2014, he described its larger competitor, Uber as, “without question, the most ethically challenged company in Silicon Valley.”</p><p>One could easily draw a line from a Transportation Secretary Tibbens to policies or contracts that favor Lyft — and thus further enrich Thiel.</p><p>And yet, Tibbens — or someone with a similar background as Tibbens — could be an interesting choice and represent the kind of outsider that Thiel seems to want to take over Washington. While Tibbens has spent the last 18 months with Lyft, presumably learning quite a bit about logistics, we’d guess he has had much to teach his colleagues, too.</p><p>Before joining Lyft, Tibbens spent three years as a VP with Amazon where, according to his LinkedIn profile, he “led the technical and product development of the delivery feature of Prime Now, Amazon’s one-hour delivery service.” Tibbens also spent less than a year as a logistics manager at Dell about 16 years ago. (He stayed on with Dell for another 11 years in a series of what seem more like corporate development positions.)</p><p>Leaving aside conflicts of interest, is that enough experience to be U. S. Transportation Secretary? We’d be inclined to say, nope. But let’s face it, the future of transportation is changing quickly; bringing in someone who has been working on the forefront of what’s expected to be a massive shift isn’t the worst idea in the world.</p><p>Not to knock the current Transportation Secretary, Anthony Foxx, but before taking the job in 2013, he didn’t have vast amounts of related experience, either. A longtime litigator, he served two terms as a city council member of Charlotte, North Carolina, then served one term as the city’s mayor before receiving his federal appointment.</p><p>As readers will already know, Thiel was widely vilified for his high-profile support of Trump before the election.</p><p>This editor had thought it was all a bit much at the time. In a post on Wednesday, however, I suggested that Trump’s win might turn off entrepreneurs who tolerated Thiel’s involvement in the campaign and might be less forgiving now that Trump has won.</p><p>That already seems to be happening. Thiel’s Trump ties may well pay off for those already close to him, however. Notably, he appears to be the only person from the tech world on Trump’s controversial transition team. Others of its members include Anthony Scaramucci, a founder and the co-managing partner of investment firm SkyBridge Capital; three of Trump’s children; Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and Rebekah Mercer, a political novice whose hedge fund father was a major donor to the Trump campaign.

Today, Viber is launching Public Accounts, a new account format for businesses and brands who want to communicate with Viber users for marketing, customer service — or a bit of both, without a user needing to add that account as a contact first.</p><p>There are some 1,000 Public Accounts that are debuting at launch, including accounts for The Huffington Post, Yandex and The Weather Channel, to send out updates and other information to users who choose to subscribe to them.</p><p>The customer service component, meanwhile, will be coming soon. Michael Shmilov, COO of Viber, told me in an interview that by the end of November, Viber’s API will be integrated with between 10 and 15 popular CRM packages. Businesses can then send and read their Viber messages alongside all of their other social media, email and messaging interactions.</p><p>Public Accounts will also open the door to Viber hosting bots as well — although Viber itself will not be building these, Shmilov tells me.</p><p>“We are focused on building the best chat experience with a scalable API, so we are not building bots ourselves,” he said. “We provide the tools for bot developers [to place them there].”</p><p>Public Accounts — which Shmilov formally announced today at at the Web Summit in Lisbon — are building on a feature that Viber added back in 2014 called “Public Chats.” This essentially let personalities — or anyone, really — run a conversation with the public, although only those who actually had the speaker as an actual contact were able to interact with him or her.</p><p>Public Accounts, Smilov pointed out, will be the first time that you (and a business) will be able to interact with each other without having each other as a contact.</p><p>Public Accounts puts Viber among several other consumer-focused messaging apps that have already started to court brands and others with special features to “speak” to those apps’ user bases.</p><p>They include WeChat and Line, which have been offering business account options since 2014 and 2015, respectively. And while Facebook Messenger came somewhat later to the party with its business launch, it’s been quick to expand and update the service with bots and other features, most recently updating the platform just yesterday.</p><p>There is a bigger trend where social media platforms are leveraging their audiences and analytics data to provide more direct services, as they look to expand their revenue potential beyond basic in-stream and display ads. Twitter also has been developing customer service functionality.</p><p>But if this is a certified trend, not all messaging apps are on board quite yet. WhatsApp has yet to announce any business services, although it said it was planning to back in January of this year. (The latest date on that seems to be by the end of this year.)</p><p>Interestingly, the fact that all the other messaging apps are jumping on the business bandwagon seems to make sense and is even a good thing, in Shmilov’s mind. The company has around 266 million active users among its 800 million overall users, and he sees Viber’s CRM functionality as simply complementing what the others are doing, creating a framework for all messaging apps to be legitimate channels for communication.</p><p>“When Viber is one of the few apps you use, we want to make sure it’s part of how you can engage with a business,” he said.</p><p>The reason for why businesses want to do more in messaging apps is pretty clear: for a good proportion of the population who use messaging apps, they have replaced a lot, if not all, email use, and for some the more direct format has replaced their use of more open platforms like Facebook and Twitter as the central place for interacting directly with others in a text-based format. And those interactions happen in real-time, a key way to ensure engagement (a holy grail for businesses).</p><p>On top of this, mobile-friendly messaging platforms are evolving into all-seeing, multifunctional platforms, with the ability to send media like stickers, make phone calls, and speak to bots that can give you recommendations for places to eat, among so much more.</p><p>So for businesses, brands or others that need or want to speak to a large group of users, or have direct interactions in cases of customer service, it makes sense that they would look to messaging platforms to try to do that. With 266 million active users, Viber is substantial enough for businesses to target.</p><p>But equally clear is the reason why these may not be to all users’ liking.</p><p>As we’ve written before, messaging platforms have risen almost as a counterbalance to open-ended platforms like Facebook’s. Whereas you can see anything and everything on Facebook or Twitter, you essentially choose who you want to talk to on messaging platforms. Having businesses start to engage on there and use it to send you stuff could pollute that experience, if it’s not handled correctly.</p><p>As for how Public Accounts will be priced, Smilov was not entirely specific on this point with me, but it sounded like it will be modelled on a freemium idea: creating the account will be free, but adding in features or using it to send things will come at a price.</p><p>“We already enable businesses and brands to publish their own content on Viber with Public Chats, and we make revenues from things like Sponsored Stickers and other promotions,” he said, explaining what will be likely the first areas where Public Accounts may also generate sales. “Apart from that, we won’t charge for Public Accounts at this stage.”</p>",

It’s historically 2-d printing over and over again and the breakthrough we [had] and wrote about in the research journal Science laid out our approach where we use light and oxygen to grow parts.”</p><p>Using Carbon’s CLIP tech, manifest in their flagship M1 machines, manufacturers can make functional prototypes, or a small volume of parts, 25 to 100 times faster than they could using other industrial 3D printers, DeSimone claims.</p><p>Parts made on Carbon machines, using the company’s cloud-based design software, resins and elastomers, have different mechanical properties and a smoother surface than parts produced on traditional CNC machines.</p><p>That’s because they’re not deposited layer by layer, cut or milled. They’re sculpted, in effect, by precisely applying light and oxygen, to a liquid pool of material. That enables users of Carbon to create lattices, which can give objects like drones or vehicles structural integrity without unnecessary weight.</p><p>Early customers of Carbon include a Hollywood special effects studio called Legacy Effects, BMW and Ford Motor Co.</p><p>Carbon also supplies its printers to service bureaus like Sculpteo, and The Technology House in Cleveland, where industrial designers or consumers can outsource custom prototyping and parts production.</p><p>By now, Carbon has leased out 50 of its machines, and expects to have 100 operating in the field by the end of the year, and 500 in the next year at least.</p><p>It also has clients and partners in aerospace, athletic apparel, automotive, consumer electronics, industrials and medical devices and equipment.</p><p>According to Carbon board member Jim Goetz, a partner at Sequoia Capital, the startup’s new, strategic backers are “lighthouse customers, people who could transform their own businesses through new approaches to manufacturing.”</p><p>He expects Carbon, long-term, has the potential to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U. S., particularly the Midwest, and could do something similar in parts of Asia and Europe where manufacturing once boomed.</p><p>The new expansion round brings Carbon’s total venture capital raised to date to $222 million. The company is valued at $1 billion.</p><p>The CEO confirmed this will likely be the last time Carbon seeks venture funding.</p><p>The company generates recurring revenue by renting out its machines, or leasing them on three-year contracts. It also generates revenue from selling resins, elastomers and other materials it develops to users of those printers.</p><p>This business model makes Carbon distinct from companies that sell large, industrial 3D printers outright.</p><p>The company is competing against large incumbents like Stratasys, which is newly committed to the industrial market for 3D printing after previous and disappointing initiatives to spark a consumer trend with desktop 3D printers.</p>",

But the learnings from that earlier experiment have now popped up in Facebook’s Messenger application as a new feature called Rooms, which is rolling out now in select markets. The limited launch is meant to serve as a test to see if Facebook’s messaging platform could encourage broader, more public conversations focused on specific topics.</p><p>There were already hints that Facebook was planning to trial Rooms on Messenger in the near future. In September, code was discovered hidden in the Messenger app that referenced a feature by the same name, which also offered some explanation of how Rooms worked.</p><p>At the time, text found in the code stated that “rooms are for public conversations about topics and interests. Each Room has a link that can be shared so anyone on Messenger can join the conversation.”</p><p>Users could also create their own Rooms via the Messenger app, invite members, approve new members, set a nickname for themselves, configure notifications and more.</p><p>Facebook said then Rooms was a small test, but offered no further comment.</p><p>Now, Rooms is becoming available to a wider audience: Australia and Canada. These countries are often places where the social network trials new products because of their English-speaking user bases, before rolling out the feature to the U. S. and other international users.</p><p>According to Facebook’s explanation of Rooms at launch, as reported by The Courier Mail, the feature is different from group chats because it’s focused on chatting around specific topics with people you may or may not know. Group chats, meanwhile, are only generally joined by family and friends you do know.</p><p>However, users will be able to set Rooms to private, and only allow those to join when they are approved by an administrator.</p><p>This could work well as an add-on for things like larger Facebook groups, where not all the members are also Facebook friends. (Or have even met in real life). But it could also help connect people around subjects they want to discuss via messaging, instead of the more formal structure of a Facebook group.</p><p>Another use case could be organizing events or sending out alerts. That’s something that could be especially interesting in light of how the larger social network has already been used to organize social and political movements — including, most recently, the anti-Trump protests that are occurring across the U. S.</p><p>The company has been busy trialing a number of new messaging experiments in recent weeks, many with the goal of challenging Snapchat.</p><p>This has included a Snapchat Stories clone called Messenger Day, which was also tested in Australia and a Snapchat clone for emerging markets, Flash. It has also tested new features for its own in-app camera on Facebook itself, as well as in Messenger. Meanwhile, its Instagram app rolled out its own version of Stories, and WhatsApp has been testing a Stories clone called Status.</p><p>Facebook confirmed to us the Rooms feature has just begun rolling out to Australian and Canadian users. At this time, only users in those regions will be able to create Rooms.</p>",

It will be much more intense, vivid, and addictive — and as AI comes online, I believe there will be a proliferation in AI-powered avatar and robotic relationships, similar to those characters depicted in the movies Her and Ex Machina.”</p><p>Let’s back up a minute. Did Diamandis really say that he thinks people will begin to form relationships with AI robots? It’s not that hard to believe, given the example of men who prefer virtual girlfriends to real ones — but how close are we to actually creating an avatar that loves you back?</p><p>To answer this, first we have to understand what AI actually is, and what AI has come to represent to the public world. There are two basic types of AI: strong AI, and applied or “weak” AI (technically, cognitive simulation, or “CS,” is another type of AI, but we’ll be focusing on these first two for now).</p><p>Strong AI is a work-in-progress, but the ultimate goal is to build a machine with intellectual ability indistinguishable from that of a normal human being. Joseph Weizenbaum of the MIT AI Laboratory has described the ultimate aim of strong AI as “nothing less than to build a machine on the model of man, a robot that is to have its childhood, to learn language as a child does, to gain its knowledge of the world by sensing the world through its own organs, and ultimately to contemplate the whole domain of human thought.”</p><p>Strong AI is also the type of AI that you hear about in the movies — the Skynet program that rebels against its human creators in the Terminator movies, or HAL 9000 of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It is predicted that if or when this type of superhuman intelligence is made possible and brought online, we will have triggered the singularity. This type of AI is years away from completion, if its completion is even possible — many contest that we will ever reach this point.</p><p>Weak/applied AI, on the other hand, is the type of thing you read about in the headlines. Anything with the adjective “smart” slapped onto it is generally relying on weak AI of some kind — any artificial form of intelligence that may “learn” and even figure out ways to write its own code, but that is limited in function to very few tasks.</p><p>The programs that drive smart cars, the chatbots that guide us through customer service and even the previously mentioned AlphaGo are all examples of weak or applied AI. These systems exist within the boundaries of a “micro-world” that the AI has recognized, and may even be so advanced as to be considered “expert systems.” These systems have no “common sense” or understanding of how their recommendations fit into a larger context, or the world beyond their micro-world. They are essentially complex input/output systems that specialize in one area, easily distinguishable from human intelligence based on these deficiencies.</p><p>The focus on a human-l</p>",

Today, Facebook announced that it’s making some changes.</p><p>The targeting allows advertisers to focus on users whose Facebook activity indicates an interest in “content relating to particular ethnic communities.” A ProPublica report suggested that these capabilities could be used for discriminatory advertising — particularly in housing and employment, where such practices are illegal.</p><p>Facebook’s response at the time was to point out that it prohibits discriminatory ad practices and said it will take down any violating ads. In a blog post published this morning, Erin Egan — Facebook’s vice president for US public policy and its chief privacy officer — said the company will go further.</p><p>To be clear, Facebook isn’t abandoning “ethnic affinity” targeting.

    "content": "<p>As artificial intelligence and machine learning mature and manifest their potential to take on complicated tasks, we’ve become somewhat expectant that robots can succeed where humans have failed — namely, in putting aside personal biases when making decisions. But as recent cases have shown, like all disruptive technologies, machine learning introduces its own set of unexpected challenges and sometimes yields results that are wrong, unsavory, offensive and not aligned with the moral and ethical standards of human society.</p><p>While some of these stories might sound amusing, they do lead us to ponder the implications of a future where robots and artificial intelligence take on more critical responsibilities and will have to be held responsible for the possibly wrong decisions they make.</p><p>At its core, machine learning uses algorithms to parse data, extract patterns, learn and make predictions and decisions based on the gleaned insights. This is the mechanics behind many of the technologies we’re seeing every day, such as search engines, face recognition apps and digital assistants. The more data you feed into a machine learning algorithm, the smarter it gets; that’s why every tech firm is looking for ways to gather more data about its customers and users.</p><p>But at the end of the day, machine learning can only be as smart as the data that’s being fed to it, and therein lies the problem — because the same data used to train machine learning algorithms can teach it to become evil or biased.</p><p>And like every child, machine learning algorithms tend to pick up the tastes and biases of the persons who rear them. What makes things even more complex is the fact that firms are very protective and discreet of the inner workings of their algorithms and treat them as trade secrets.</p><p>Beauty.ai, a machine learning startup, held the world’s first AI-driven beauty contest this year. More than 6,000 people submitted their pictures to have their attractiveness evaluated based on factors such as symmetry and wrinkles.</p><p>This was supposed to relieve us of the social biases that human judges have. But the results turned out to be somewhat disappointing: Of the 44 winners, the majority were white, a few were Asian and only one was dark-skinned. The problem, as one researcher explained to Motherboard, was that the image samples used to train the algorithms weren’t balanced in terms of race and ethnicity.</p><p>This is not the first time that machine learning’s white guy problem became an issue. Earlier this year, a language processing algorithm was found to judge white-sounding names such as Emily and Matt to be more pleasant than black-sounding names such as Jamal and Ebony.</p><p>In another instance, Microsoft was forced to shut down Tay, the chatbot that was designed to mimic the behavior of a teenage girl, after it started spewing offensive tweets. Tay was supposed to ingest comments from users, process them and learn to respond in personalized ways. But it seems that users were more interested in teaching racism and Nazism to Tay.</p><p>But what happens in more sensitive situations, such as when a person’s life or freedom is at stake? ProPublica research in May found that an algorithm used by law enforcement in Florida gave a higher score to black people when assessing the probability of convicts committing crimes in the future.</p><p>The list of machine learning fiascos are nearly endless, including a Google algorithm that marked black people as gorillas, an ad delivery engine that is less likely to show high-paying job propositions to women and a news algorithm that promotes fake and sometimes vulgar stories.</p><p>Where traditional software is involved, deciding whether an error was due to a user mistake or a design flaw in the software is pretty straightforward.</p><p>But machine learning is not so transparent, and one of its biggest challenges is determining responsibilities. Developing machine learning software is dramatically different from traditional coding, and is as much about training the algorithms as it is about writing the software. Even the creators cannot predict with exact precision how the machine will decide, and sometimes become amazed with the results they yield.</p><p>Therefore, things got a bit murky when Facebook was accused of being politically biased about its “Trending Topics” module, a component that is at least partly powered by machine learning. And when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump accused Google of tweaking its search engine’s results to suppress bad news about Hillary Clinton, transparently debunking the claim and explaining the mechanics proved a bit complicated.</p><p>Things get more sensitive when critical decisions are conferred to artificial intelligence. For instance, if a self-driving vehicle decides to run down a pedestrian, who will be held accountable? The driver — or more precisely, the owner — of the car or the developer of the machine learning algorithm?</p><p>Erasing bias from databases is the key to creating impartial machine learning algorithms. But creating a balanced database is by itself a complicated feat. There is currently no type of regulation or standard governing the data that is used to train machine learning algorithms, and researchers sometimes use and share off-the-shelf frameworks and databases that already have bias ingrained into them.</p><p>One solution would be to create shared and regulated databases that are in possession of no single entity, thus preventing any party from unilaterally manipulating the data to their own favor.</p><p>A notable effort in this regard is the foundation of the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, a historic partnership between Facebook, Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, some of the leading voices in machine learning innovations, to address some of the fears stemming from the growth of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Part of the goals of the Partnership on AI include addressing the ethical issues of artificial intelligence, and to make su</p>",

    "content": "<p>OpenStack, the open source cloud computing platform that allows enterprises to essentially run their own version of AWS in their data centers, was founded by NASA and Rackspace in 2010. Today, it’s being used by the likes of Comcast, PayPal, Volkswagen, CERN, AT&T, China Mobile and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs in the U. K. The OpenStack Foundation’s bi-annual developer conferences now regularly attract thousands of developers and while the project started with only a few core services (compute, storage and networking), it now features six core services and about 60 small projects under its umbrella.</p><p>After 14 releases in the last six years, it’s clear that OpenStack is now a pretty mature project; that definitely showed at the project’s latest developer conference in Barcelona, Spain this week.</p><p>A few years ago, the question everybody asked at these OpenStack Summits was whether anybody was actually running the software in production and whether it was ready for the enterprise. Both of those points are now moot. According to a study by 451 Research, most OpenStack-powered clouds are now between 1,000 and 10,000 cores in size — and five percent top 100,000 cores. The majority of the project’s enterprise uses run their infrastructure services, business applications and big data workloads, as well as web service and e-commerce applications on the platform.</p><p>Even though OpenStack has reached this level of success, there is still occasionally an air of insecurity around the project. After the startup ecosystem around the project bloomed a few years ago, the inevitable consolidation set in last year, with the shutdown of Nebula, a company that sold hardware and software based on OpenStack, being the main bellwether. In addition, a few other startups in the OpenStack ecosystem also recently shut down. And while HP and later HPE remain major backers of the project, HPE recently laid off many of its OpenStack engineers, even though it’s still actively trying to sell OpenStack to its customers — especially in the telco world.</p><p>Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth told me that it’s time for a reality check for OpenStack and the vendors in its ecosystem. He’s probably a bit more pessimistic about OpenStack than I am, though. Time and again, this year’s Summit focused on OpenStack’s telco customers and the fact that they are using the software to replace a lot of their expensive proprietary hardware with software (the buzz acronym here is NFV — network function virtualization). Those users include Deutsche Telekom, AT&T and numerous telcos in China, where OpenStack is growing especially quickly. Indeed, China Mobile and Deutsche Telekom both became gold-level sponsors of the project this week.</p><p>While telco’s are more agile today than they were only a few years ago, this is still a very conservative industry, with long sales and deployment cycles. The simple fact that these companies are betting on OpenStack — in addition to everybody else who is already on board — gives me plenty of confidence in the project’s long-term prospects.</p><p>Rackspace CTO John Engates is probably more positive about OpenStack’s future than I am, though. He told me that he believes all Fortune 100 companies will use OpenStack in some form or another within the next three years (half already do today). He does think, however, that awareness of the project in the C-Suite is still lacking, but that having major backers like Comcast and Walmart means we’ll see a trickle-down effect where even mid-sized companies will take a look at OpenStack in the long term. As Rackspace’s general manager for its OpenStack private cloud business Bryan Thompson also noted, the company is now seeing more mid-sized enterprises interested in OpenStack and its current customers are often growing their OpenStack commitment and either expanding their existing clouds or launching new ones in different geographies.</p><p>For the longest time, the OpenStack community also discussed how to integrate containers (and whether they were a threat that could eventually bring down the whole house that Rackspace and NASA built). At this point, that discussion seems settled. OpenStack now features multiple services that make running containers on OpenStack easier. Indeed, it seems like the OpenStack community is making a pretty big bet on containers and, while it’s not taking sides, Kubernetes seems to be at the top of mind of the community as a whole.</p><p>While working with the container community seems to have come naturally, though, the project’s executive director (and hobby cattle farmer) Jonathan Bryce admitted that the community should do more to reach out to other open source projects so it can benefit from the innovation that happens outside of its immediate scope.</p><p>Rackspace’s Engates told me that last year, he predicted that this would be the year that OpenStack would become boring — not because it isn’t a successful project anymore but because it’ll be stable, there won’t be any drama and because it’s chugging along just fine. He’s probably right. But the team behind the project is also clearly looking to keep innovating because standing still is obviously not an option in technology and we’ve already seen that OpenStack (like the Borg) is at its best when it assimilates new technologies like containers.</p>",

Cinematch was as straightforward as it sounds: With user-submitted data, the technology could predict which movies a user may or may not enjoy. With it, Netflix created personalized movie recommendation lists, custom-built for each individual user.</p><p>Cinematch worked, but behind the scenes, Netflix worried it was not operating at full potential. So, in a move completely unheard of at the time, Netflix made public a huge set of its anonymous rating data and issued a global challenge: develop an algorithm that could beat it.</p><p>The Netflix Prize, as it came to be known, was the first large-scale public crowdsourced competition of its kind. The competition helped draw attention to the value of recommendation engines across the world. Soon, e-commerce companies were touting similar technology, and, as a result, the internet became a better place for consumers and for brands. The Netflix Prize opened new doors for data science, and pushed it to new heights.</p><p>Now, nearly 10 years since we handed out the million-dollar Netflix Prize, I think it’s time for five more industries to issue a “Netflix Prize” of their own. By crowdsourcing for solutions using machine learning to utilize the abundant data available across these five industries, we can find relevant signals and patterns among the noise and make these industries not only more efficient, but also more integral to improving our lives.</p><p>The security industry, and specifically methods around risk and fraud detection, is a very rules-driven market. When consumers make purchases online or in stores with a credit card, the card issuer will run a quick approval process that involves questions such as: Is the consumer’s account in good standing? Is the card being used at a merchant that’s relevant to the consumer? Is the location of the store in line with locations of recent purchases? Based on these (and several more) data points, the transaction is either approved or denied.</p><p>These rules-based authentication systems are woefully incomplete, and often unable to adapt the changing nature of data. There is so much more data about consumers and their devices, both online and offline, that can be taken into consideration.</p><p>A crowdsourced competition, like the Netflix Prize, could provide the opportunity to expose user patterns across devices, time and location to uncover unique user behavior that provides a more complete view of the purchaser. Ultimately, applying machine learning to the security industry could allow security teams to build adaptive learning strategies to not only make fraudulent transactions less likely, but also ensure legitimate transactions aren’t flagged.</p><p>Data is the key to saving lives, but right now, pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers largely operate in their own silos. This is a poorly designed system for solving critical health issues. A crowdsourced Netflix Prize for medicine and healthcare could produce radical results.</p><p>In fact, there is already evidence to support it. In 2012, the pharmaceutical company Merck hosted a contest wherein it shared data on the chemical structure of thousands of different molecules, and tasked the scientific community to identify which might lead to new and better drugs. The winning result demonstrated a 17 percent improvement over the industry standard benchmark, and blazed new avenues for pharmaceutical research aided by machine learning.</p><p>If we were able to input every piece of data from every drug study, we could potentially make better predictions about drugs.</p><p>Beyond chemical data, patients have generations’ worth of family data we willingly provide to doctors. From heart-rate records, urine samples, family history, blood pressure and pages and pages of doctors’ notes, the body is one large data science dream. If we apply big data machine learning techniques to all of that data, while complying with HIPAA patient confidentiality, could medical professionals detect patterns and susceptibilities in families and individuals before they become a problem? Likewise, if we were able to input every piece of data from every drug study, we could potentially make better predictions about drugs, beyond even the Merck example.</p><p>In the world of advertising and marketing technology, a big gap that every brand, agency and enterprise faces is digital identity. The issue stems from the global phenomenon of device proliferation. Between our smartphones, tablets, laptops, connected TVs, smartwatches and even connected cars, our digital lives are extremely fragmented, and customer experiences on the internet are largely broken.</p><p>Facebook, Google, Amazon, Netflix and others have “solved” this by forcing a login. For example, my Facebook News Feed is identical on mobile and desktop; Amazon recommended products that are consistent across devices and unique to me. But what about the rest of the internet? What about the time I spend online and in apps where I’m not logged in?</p><p>The good news is that the internet, by definition, is a boundless sea of data. Browser data, device data, location data, usage data, network data — enough data to keep an army of data scientists busy trying to resolve identity by using these signals. Several companies are already addressing this question of digital identity, but there are few, if any, open standards and very limited collaboration.</p><p>If solved by a crowdsourced data science competition, digital identity can revolutionize online experiences for both brands and consumers. Recommendations and content can be personalized, and marketing can be automated. Cross-device attribution becomes simple, and the marketer’s view of consumers becomes holistic.</p><p>Think of all the data we issue every morning while combating our daily commutes. We input data to Waze, share our location and speed with GPS, drive through speed monitor zones and even provide license plate information and traffic patterns w</p>",

Under the terms of the deal, Broadcom will pay $12.75 per share.</p><p>It’s an all-cash $5.5 billion transaction with Broadcom also assuming $400 million of net debt for the total of $5.9 billion.</p><p>While Brocade has a broader networking business, under the terms of the deal, Broadcom will divest the IP networking part of the business including Ruckus Wireless, a company Brocade just recently acquired.</p><p>It seems what Broadcom had its eye on was the networking storage part of the business and the company believes that by combining the two lines, they could create a powerful entity in the fibre channel Storage Area Network (SAN) business.</p><p>In a blog post on the Brocade community blog, CEO Lloyd Carney indicated his company wasn’t looking to sell, but Broadcom offered a deal so compelling they couldn’t refuse. A 47 percent share price premium will tend to do that.</p><p>But the company also saw an opportunity to create a networking storage powerhouse by combining with Broadcom. “As part of this transaction, our Storage Area Network (SAN) business, will offer a strong complement to Broadcom’s offerings and capabilities, creating one of the industry’s broadest portfolios for enterprise storage,” Carney wrote in the blog post.</p><p>Carney indicated that the two companies decided to sell the rest of the networking business because of “competitive overlap with some of Broadcom’s most important customers.” In other words, Broadcom didn’t need that part of Brocade’s business competing with what it was already offering, and it didn’t have enough unique customers to make keeping it worthwhile (and I suspect it will also help pay for the deal as well).</p><p>The nature of the deal in which they are planning to sell off parts of the business will have to create a level of uncertainty among Brocades’s current customer base. The company blog post did little to address that. Ruckus Wireless, the company it bought last April suddenly finds itself in no-man’s land with no clear understanding of who its owner will ultimately be.</p><p>Broadcom itself was sold to Avago in a massive $37 billion deal in May, 2015, but apparently can continue to make its own deals, even as part of the larger entity.</p><p>Today’s deal is expected to close in October next year, and is of course going to be subject to regulatory approval.</p>",

The idea is that you should know your user and deliver content that matters to each visitor. The combined resources of these two companies could help bring that closer to reality.</p><p>Jeroen Verberg, co-founder and CEO at Hippo certainly sees the potential. “We’ve been focused on building relevant web experiences. We can leverage data and machine learning in [BloomReach’s] products to drive know-how deep into our product,” he said.</p><p>Verberg said he wasn’t shopping the company, but he has had lots of conversations and when BloomReach came along, he liked the idea of being acquired by a startup, rather than being swallowed up by a larger organization. It also helped the technology from the two companies were complimentary, but didn’t necessarily overlap in a direct way.</p><p>In the near term Hippo will operate under its own brand as a BloomReach company with the two companies combining in a more official way in 2017 with content and commerce businesses under one umbrella. While the companies wouldn’t comment on how long the Hippo management team was contractually obligated to remain with BloomReach after the purchase, it is worth noting that Verberg is joining the BloomReach board of directors as part of the deal.</p><p>This was not the first acquisition for the company. BloomReach acquired ShopLogic in 2013, but De Datta acknowledged as a startup that he had to work closely with his investors and Board of Directors before pulling the trigger on today’s deal.</p><p>With the acquisition, which has already closed, the company has 300 employees — Hippo’s 100 person operation combined with BloomReach’s 200 employees. The acquisition not only provides BloomReach with Hippo’s web content management technology, it also gets a strong presence in Europe to combine with its existing office in London. Hippo also has a strong North American presence with an office in Boston.</p><p>BloomReach launched in 2009 and has raised $97 million. The most recent round was a $56 million Series D last January.</p>",

    "content": "<p>It’s true, Facebook isn’t single-handedly responsible for the outcome of the U. S. presidential election. But the company played an important part in the rise of Donald Trump. Many people now think Facebook has to find a way to flag fake news appropriately before the next election in 2020. But it’s a much more urgent issue.</p><p>Facebook has to weed out fake news before the Dutch, French, Kenyan, Chilean, and many, many other elections in 2017. These elections could see populist candidates triumph once again.</p><p>The company shouldn’t just question its responsibility when there’s an election in the U. S. Given Facebook’s penetration rate around the world, Facebook is now in charge of propagating news in most countries.</p><p>I’m tired of seeing Facebook burying its head in the sand on this issue. Instead of issuing multiple half-hearted statements saying that “everything is fine,” Facebook should be open and transparent about this issue.</p><p>It doesn’t matter if Facebook thinks that everything is fine and well. Millions of people now think that Facebook could do a better job when it comes to news articles in the news feed. So the company should work on it. It seems like a reasonable thing to ask as this is exactly what technology companies are supposed to do. They iterate, improve their products over time and add new features.</p><p>But the worst part is that Facebook’s incentive aren’t directly aligned with everyone’s incentive. Fake news articles spread like a virus. They create a lot of engagement. They improve the number of daily active users, which leads to more ad engagement, which leads to better quarterly earnings.</p><p>And yet, it doesn’t matter if Facebook’s quarter is awesome thanks to the presidential election if the company becomes irrelevant in five years. Facebook has to act now to protect its long-term reputation.</p><p>Even more important, I’d even say that this issue could greatly damage the economy in many countries, which could have indirect effects on the company’s bottom line. Facebook tends to boost the so-called anti-establishment candidates. Many of them are just populists who want to destroy existing policies in favor of alternative policies that exclude immigrants, minorities and demolish the welfare state. Dividing people into groups and pitting them against each other will never lead to systemic economic growth.</p><p>And because of Facebook’s algorithm, populist candidates with a vocal fanbase can use Facebook as a megaphone to convert new people. It doesn’t matter if something is true or false. Many people are now looking for articles that will validate their views and share them ad nauseam. That’s why it’s important to fix the megaphone.</p><p>“But free speech!” you might say. Facebook isn’t a balanced platform in the first place. You choose your friends on Facebook, and they tend to validate your opinion. After Trump’s election, many of my friends told me something along the lines of “I thought my liberal bubble was bigger than it actually is and I blame Facebook.” How many people did you unfriend because they shared some nonsensical article about Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?</p><p>Given that most people share articles without even reading these articles in the first place, Facebook should at least flag articles when they’re fake so that people know what they’re dealing with.</p><p>I’m not saying that Facebook should stop you from posting all sorts of articles. People should be able to share cute kitten videos as well as conspiracy theories. But if people don’t even click on the links before sharing them, Facebook should put a question mark and say “you should think twice before sharing this.” That’s the least the company can do.</p><p>This issue isn’t just affecting Facebook. It turns out that Facebook is the bigger player in this space, so the focus is on Facebook right now. But Twitter, Google search results, YouTube and all social networks should take a minute and think about what they’re going to do over the next few months to fix their platforms.</p><p>I can’t help but feel a sense of urgency around Facebook’s plague of fake news. If Facebook can’t fix its platform, France will end up with Marine Le Pen. In other words, no, Facebook, it’s not time to issue 18 different statements saying that sure, maybe one day Facebook will consider thinking about someday drafting a new feature that will reduce the reach of fake news. It’s time to act now before all world leaders are demagogues.</p><p>It all comes down to a simple question — is Facebook a technology company or a media company? When the company fired its human editors for Trending Topics, Facebook made a clear choice in favor of algorithms.</p><p>But by putting the algorithms in charge, Facebook unintentionally made an editorial decision. Facebook doesn’t get to decide if it is a media company or not. It gets to set its own editorial rules and enforce them using a combination of algorithms and humans.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Touch Bar is an interesting proposition. Part innovation, part work around. The technology is Apple’s attempt to embrace a new form of input while continuing to eschew touchscreen on its computers. I was mostly pleasantly surprised by the technology, in terms of its capability, versatility and responsiveness, but for now, it’s not exactly a game changer.</p><p>The Touch Bar is an intriguing piece of real estate, planted between the keyboard and display, where the function keys once lived. “This is crazy,” Phil Schiller said about the old row during the MacBook Pro’s debut the other week, “keeping 45-year-old technology around and mapping other things to them.”</p><p>I’m not sure the rest of us we’re eagerly awaiting someone to do away with the row of function keys, but maybe that’s why Schiller gets paid the big bucks.</p><p>In some cases, the Bar feels like a tradeoff. Certain functionality now takes a couple of extra clicks to access, and the whole set up just isn’t as customizable as it could be. And it will be a while before third-party support is anywhere near ubiquitous. Even so, there are still a lot of cool tricks to be performed with Apple’s proprietary software, as the company looks to demonstrate the versatility of the new technology across its own offerings.</p><p>Customizing the Finder: This is at once one of the simplest and most compelling bits of functionality. Click into View in the Finder, and the screen will go translucent. From here, you can customize your favorites by dragging and dropping different buttons onto the bar. It’s the one place where the user can currently interact directly between the screen and Touch Bar in this manner – and it opens the door to a lot of potentially innovative usage. It also, hopefully, hints at a more customizable future for the Touch Bar in its various apps.</p><p>Media Scrubbing: This is one of the spots where Apple has focused the new technology on media professionals. The Touch Bar is a really intuitive way to scrub through media, be it when editing in apps like Final Cut or Garage Band (iMovie functionality is sadly lacking) or playback in iTunes or while watching video.</p><p>Photo Galleries: The principle is similar here, but in this instance, the functionality takes better advantage of the Retina Display resolution, offering thumbnails of your photos, so you can scroll through a lot quickly. Of course, the 2170 × 60 resolution coupled with limited real estate means they’re pretty small.</p><p>Calendar: The Touch Bar offers a quick way to swipe through the endless scrolling of the months and years. All we are is dust in the wind.</p><p>Phone Calls: For whatever reason, I don’t take a lot of calls on my computer. Yet I Skype all the time. It doesn’t even occur to me to try out the functionality until I got an incoming call while working on the review. The strip lights up and you can take it directly from the Touch Bar. Once on, you can hang up, mute or switch to video. All the while, it displays the name of the person on the line, coupled with how long you’ve been on. The feature will no doubt work well with Skype, too.</p><p>Text Formatting: A little dull, but I like it. Highlight text and you can change the alignment, style, font and customize the color with a few taps. It’s a feature that’s much handier day to day than predictive text – which makes a lot more sense on the limited real estate thumb typing of a smartphone screen than a full-on QWERTY laptop.</p><p>Emojis: Like it or not, the Touch Bar is offering big back door for emojis to make it onto the computer in a major way. And the Retina Display is pretty much exactly the perfect size for showcasing smiling poop and happy faces.</p><p>Honorable mentions go out to Maps, which features icons for different businesses, so you can choose a place Yelp-style and Safari, where tabs appear, so you can quickly scroll through everything you’ve got open.</p>",

S. car rental giant Avis.</p><p>The partnership will Avis introduce an option for booking cars overseas — in 175 countries, to be precise — inside the Didi app. The option is strictly for booking cars, not chauffeured cars or taxis. The upshot is that Chinese tourists who are traveling abroad get a fairly convenient way to plan their travel once they land and before they jet off, assuming that they want their own four-wheels.</p><p>TechCrunch understands that the initial integration will go live in early 2017 ahead of Chinese New Year at the end of January. (That makes sense since many Chinese travel overseas for the holiday period.) Further down the line, Didi may increase its integration with Avis to allow users to book cars — and potentially more — on the ground once overseas.</p><p>This isn’t a spectacular, fireworks-filled first push overseas, but it is a move that could play a part in helping Didi to identify countries where its users are particular keen to manage their transportation options, and thus markets where the company could expand its services organically. Yes, Didi does have investments in Uber rivals in the U. S. (Lyft), India (Ola) and Southeast Asia (Grab), but it has said that its global expansion could come in the form of starting its own operations or buying local services. There’s no word on when the global expansion may come, for that matter.</p><p>Perhaps interesting to note, Didi confirmed to us that this “strategic partnership” does not include any investment on either side.

    "content": "<p>Every time there is a conference where we get saturated coverage from a given company, we tend to buy into their vision, at least for the couple of days the company has our undivided attention. Last week, Facebook had its turn at F8 and boy, did it push Messenger and Messenger bots hard.</p><p>Bots, for those of you who might be unfamiliar with them, are pre-programmed interactions you can have with a business or media inside Messenger, a kind of conversation with a machine. They have the capacity for some intelligence and over time they can learn, based on your interactions, to get better at anticipating your needs (at least in theory).</p><p>That certainly sounds impressive and we covered it extensively here at TechCrunch (including my story on Messenger traffic channel tools in Salesforce and Zendesk). Perhaps my favorite story on the subject was from my colleague Sarah Perez, who tried the three Messenger bots featured at the announcement and came away wholly unimpressed.</p><p>As Sarah rightly pointed out, it’s early and maybe we can give them a break, but when you’re hyping something to the degree Facebook was hyping Messenger bots last week, you probably want to get the early examples right or risk losing the crucial early adopters who think this kind of technology is pretty cool.</p><p>The real question to me is do we want Messenger to be the center of our lives? Sure, I can ask a weather bot to text me the weather every day, but I can also open up the Weather app on my iPhone to get the same information quickly, and it’s a lot prettier than the text-based message the weather service sends me.</p><p>The thing is, if we started using Messenger for everything, how will we get the messages from our friends and family we actually want to see (presumably)? And then there’s the whole business of ads or what Facebook calls “sponsored messages,” which will mean you have even more extraneous stuff to wade through just to get those meaningful conversations.</p><p>Let’s not forget Messenger is just one chat client out of many out there and they aren’t the only ones using bots either. Sure Messenger has the huge audience, but how much can you use it before you start abusing that audience?</p><p>What’s more, the bot is a pretty primitive way of interacting.

The company said it is using an existing company’s solution for this headset though they declined to comment on specific partners.</p><p>Eye-tracking can deliver a superior experience to users by giving them another way to interact with onscreen content. On the computing side, eye-tracking can also lighten system constraints through a process called foveated rendering, by which the full display resolution is only rendered at the center of your gaze, mimicking how the human eye actually works.</p><p>Most experts suggest that at such “low” resolutions (compared to say 8K per eye), foveated rendering really doesn’t do anything to lighten computing loads, but Qualcomm decided to include the feature on this reference design regardless.</p><p>All-in-one headset designs are a bit of a strange beast right now, most smartphones aren’t optimized for high-quality mobile VR experiences, that being said the price-of-entry is much lower for consumers who only need to purchase a cheap no-frills headset that houses their mobile device. Meanwhile these all-in-one headsets will likely sport exceptional price tags while not holding to the established quality standards on tethered headsets.</p><p>Intel showed off designs for its all-in-one Project Alloy VR headset a few weeks ago, and while there are some differences in capabilities, it’s clear that both companies see wireless VR as where the industry is headed. While Intel used its headset to highlight the power of its Real Sense positional tracking system, Qualcomm is interestingly the one looking to show off its chipset.</p><p>Qualcomm’s VR820 SoC is going to be available in Q4 of this year, and the company detailed that headsets utilizing the system architecture would be available soon after.</p>",

Or to enjoy the financial returns of the exit. No, as a Japanese expat in London as COO of Quipper, she wanted to create a dating services that matches Asian singles who are based overseas.</p><p>“In London, I wanted to meet someone who shared my culture and language, and could talk to my parents. It was very hard on existing dating sites because they tend to group all Asians together. I thought: “There’s JDate for Jewish matches, and a number for black people, why isn’t there one for Asians?””</p><p>Thus she went ahead and founded East Meets East.</p><p>The New York-based service that is currently active in six cities in the U. S.. Rather than Tinder, Tokioka describes it as a matchmaking service. That’s to say that users find each other through shared likes, activities and interests and, if they like what they see, they can message the other person. It is geared towards ‘romance’ rather than ‘hooking up.’</p><p>The service is available on the web and an iOS app, with an Android app likely to come some point in early 2017. The company is working on artificial intelligence to help make matches more relevant.</p><p>East Meets East is free for women, but men who want to join are charged $30 per month.</p><p>“It’s basically ladies night concept,” Tokioka explained. “Statistically Asian women are wanted more [by men of other ethnicities], but Asian men are not so much desired.”</p><p>Straight to the point, perhaps, but she said that most of the company’s target male audience are ok with paying, while most can afford it, too. She wouldn’t be drawn on the number of users that the service has, but said the total has grown three-fold over the past year.</p><p>One key user acquisition channel for new users has been YouTube celebrities, Tokioka said. Some of those that East Meets East have worked with include the Fung Brothers, David So, Linda Dong and Wong-Fu Production’s ISATV.</p><p>“Asian Americans are the fastest growing minority group in the U. S., which grew 56 percent from 2000 to 2013, and surpassed the 15 million mark in the United States. Globally, 60 percent of the world population lives in Asia accounting for more than 4.4 billion people,” Tokioka added in a statement.</p><p>With that global data in mind, Tokioka said that East Meets East plans to expand into Asia where it will stick to its guns and help match singles from the same background and culture. Initially, the plan is to expand to all parts of the U. S. over the next nine months and, following that, Tokioka wants to move into Canada, Australia, the UK and Hong Kong.</p><p>East Meets East revealed today that it has raised $1 million of initial funding from 500 Startups, East Ventures, Japanese games firm DeNA, iSGS Investment Works, and Shintaro Yamada, founder of Japan-based unicorn Mercari. Tokioka said that the company, which currently has 10 staff, will look to raise more money next year ahead of its international expansion.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Pivotal has a couple of new friends with big wallets. Today it announced that Ford and Microsoft were joining EMC, VMware and GE as investment partners on a massive $253 million Series C investment with a whopping $2.8 billion valuation.</p><p>It’s not a coincidence that Pivotal has been working closely with Ford over the last year to help it in its own transformation from a car company to what Ford VP and CIO Marcy Klevorn called a “mobility” company driven by software development. Klevorn’s company is contributing $182.2 million of the round and Klevorn is joining Pivotal’s board as part of the deal.</p><p>One of the first projects to come out of the collaboration between Pivotal and Ford was the recently released FordPass, which Ford is billing as super innovative. In reality, it allows you to monitor your car from a smart phone app, access car sharing services and find parking spaces, among other things. While these are all useful services they aren’t innovative in the true sense because they’ve been done in various guises before. What is new is the programming methodology that went into developing FordPass, and Ford is hoping that by making this substantial investment in Pivotal, it will be able to continue to build on this initial success.</p><p>Unlike many companies born with the help of venture capital, Pivotal was launched three years ago by EMC and VMware — with a 10 percent investment from GE — as a kind of disruptive company that could move much more quickly than either of these publicly traded behemoths could on their own. Pivotal, which has now raised $358 million provides customers with the technology and a programming methodology for changing the way they develop products. The main idea is bringing a digital mindset and software design sense to companies that have operated in a more traditional fashion.</p><p>Among its key technology products are Pivotal Cloud Foundry, an open source Platform as a Service offering that enables customers (and others) to build cloud applications on top of it and its Big Data Suite, a set of tools for processing and analyzing big data sets.</p><p>It worth noting that Pivotal’s primary investors, EMC and VMware are ensnared in the $67 billion acquisition by Dell and all that entails, but it is an independently run company and all indications are it will remain that way. Just the other day when Michael Dell announced a new name for the combined Dell-EMC organizations, he indicated that Pivotal would continue on with its own branding.</p><p>There were reports last November suggesting that Pivotal could IPO early this year. As it turns out, it’s been a slow year for tech IPOs with Dell (coincidentally or not) being the lone company to venture out, spinning off SecureWorks in an IPO last month.</p><p>The company still plans to IPO eventually says Pivotal president and COO Bill Cook, but with this kind of cash in pocket the company can easily afford to wait for the market to get a bit more friendly. For now, it’s doing quite well boasting that among its clients are 7 of the top 10 U. S. Banks, 3 of the top five auto companies (including Ford, of course), and five of the top 10 telecommunications companies.</p><p>With this cash, Pivotal could expand its product development, hire engineers and developers and move into foreign markets. Cook was pretty closed-mouthed about details, saying that it was likely the company would expand beyond the 2000 employees it currently has, but just how many that would involve in the coming year or so and how it would be distributed among various departments and offices, he wasn’t willing to say.</p><p>The biggest question here is how well this methodology will scale. It has worked reasonably well in helping large organizations at least begin transforming into digitally driven companies to this point, but what’s not clear is how this will translate as the company grows and has to make this process work for an increasingly large customer base.</p><p>Whatever happens, they certainly have the cash to try some experiments, and apply their own methods in-house and see what works and what doesn’t as they become a much larger organization over the next couple of years.</p>",

    "content": "<p>My MacBook Pro is on its last legs. The anti-glare laminate began bubbling up some time ago, spreading across the screen like an untreatable rash, fogging up the webcam in the process. The hinge is loose, so the screen shakes when someone walks by. The little black rubber bumpers have fallen off the bottom and, every so often, there’s an audible buzz of a fan rumbling from under the hood that can only be silenced with a swift smack by the heel of my hand. Also, the battery’s been having issues for a while.</p><p>My 2012 MacBook Pro has been through a lot. It’s traveled the world in a carry-on and survived several Apple live blogs and CESes, attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion and C-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. I’ve promised to put it out to pasture many times over, patiently awaiting the company to offer a truly meaningful refresh of the line, but each year I’ve held out, largely unimpressed by what the company has had to offer as it diverted resources to other product lines.</p><p>Now, finally, the time has come. A full four years after the last major upgrade, the new MacBook Pro is finally here. It’s slimmer and lighter than its predecessor, while maintaining a majority of its iconic aluminum design language. The internals have been souped up, along with the keyboard, touchpad and speakers. There’s a lot to like here.</p><p>The ports have been — well, they’ve been changed, in typical Apple fashion, a move toward future-proofing with a fair bit of growing pains, like the SCSI and Ethernet ports, optical drive and headphone jack before it. Courage. In a few years, perhaps we’ll laugh about all of this, wondering what we were so up in arms about, content with the uniformity and ability to charge from each and load up our desks with giant 5K monitors. The road to transition, however, will be paved with adapters.</p><p>And then, of course, there’s the Touch Bar. Far and away the most compelling addition to the system, the skinny touchscreen Retina display offers a new input paradigm. It’s a way for the company to continue to avoid the Windows 10 route, eschewing full touchscreen functionality while still offering the ability for users to touch-poke a swipe at a proxy.</p><p>It’s a sort of halfway point between a touchpad and touchscreen that lets Apple have its cake and eat it too. It also opens up the system to some compelling new workflow and computing possibilities as more parties develop for the feature.</p><p>After four years without a fundamental refresh, Apple has returned with a system that builds up some of the system’s strongest selling points, while introducing some tricks, and a few pain points along the way.</p><p>The MacBook Pro has been a lot of things to a lot of people over the years, but the word “sleek” has never really applied. That was never really the point. The MacBook Pro has always been about being a powerhouse. It’s right there in the name, a product targeted toward the company’s base of creative professionals looking for something more portable than a desktop. Of course, that appeal has spilled over into other users simply looking for something with a little more under the hood than an Air.</p><p>The latest upgrade maintains much of the design language of its predecessor, while taking a few cues from the standard MacBook, with smoothed out lines and even fewer parts making up its unibody exterior. That long black plastic strip on the rear of the computer is gone. So too, interestingly, is the iconic glowing Apple on the lid, replaced, for better or worse, with a mirror version.</p><p>At 14.9 mm, the 13-inch version is 17 percent thinner than its predecessor. The 15-inch version is down 14 percent from the previous version, at 15.5 mm. The system volume is noticeably streamlined as well, down 23 and 20 percent, respectively, along with a half-pound weight drop for both laptops, down to three and four pounds apiece. It’s not exactly night and day — and the 15-inch version will still feel pretty massive for those who have been carrying around an Air for all this time, but as someone who’s schlepped the previous system around for hundreds of miles on convention center floors, it’s undoubtedly an upgrade.</p><p>And the build quality here is undeniable. The new MacBook Pro is a beautifully designed piece of machinery, enhanced by the edition of the MacBook’s Space Gray coloring, a dark, almost gun-metal shading that plays well into the overall sleekness of the machine. The more traditional silver coloring has survived the upgrade, as well, so if you’re partial to a light shade, you can tick off that option during the check-out process.</p><p>Asked about the end of the SD slot, an outspoken Apple VP told The Independent that it was “bit of a cumbersome slot,” referring not to the port so much in its inert form so much as how the whole thing looks with a card sticking out its side. I’ll confess that I’ve come pretty close on numerous occasions to accidentally snapping a card in half after forgetting that I’d left it in the computer, but the word cumbersome never crossed my mind.</p><p>And as plenty of tech pundits have been more than happy to point out, an adapter is a heck of a lot more cumbersome than half of an SD card. It’s a strange sort of calculus, one that seems to point to a company more focused on the beauty of its hardware in a stationary position, recalling shades of the iPhone 7’s headphone jack adapter and the MacBook Air’s standalone optical drive. And perhaps more to the point, it marks the end of a feature that spoke directly to photographers and videographers who have been longtime devotees to Apple’s hardware.</p><p>The loss of the SD slot is likely to have less of a direct impact on more mainstream consumers, but the impact of the move to four uniform USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports will be felt almost immediately. For Apple, the update marks a bold step into a future in which USB-C makes up the majority of peripherals. And we’re no doubt moving in that direction. Meantime, adapters. A</p>",

It previously told TechCrunch it had picked up 17 million rides in October, more than 2.4x’s the amount the company did at the same time last year.</p><p>And with the growth comes a sleeker, more mature brand, it seems. That includes a new “Ride on the Bright Side” ad campaign presumably taking on Uber and new LED dashboard display to replace the hot pink glowstache drivers have been using for the past nearly two years as nighttime identifiers.</p><p>Lyft denies report -- okay, tweet -- suggesting its COO is in talks with Trump's transition team</p><p>Uber and Lyft try to get out the vote</p><p>Lyft picked up 17 million rides in October, up more than twice that amount from last year</p><p>Drivers will now get a pill-shaped Bluetooth-connected, LED display called Amp to help riders identify which Lyft ride belongs to them.</p><p>Amp comes onto the scene at a time when Lyft, Uber and other ridesharing companies are eager to shave off as much time as possible between the time you book a ride to when a car picks you up and Lyft believes Amp will help it do that by helping drivers and passengers find each other faster — This is especially true at night when it’s hard to see the true color of a car and even harder to read license plates.</p><p>“Every second is a win. It’s a win for the driver because they are able to make money faster. It’s a win for the passenger because it shaves seconds off their time getting to their end destination,” Lyft’s VP of product Tali Rapaport says.</p><p>But more importantly to Lyft, time saved on rides means more rides and more money in the company’s pocket.</p><p>The glowstache was consistently popular among drivers TechCrunch spoke to over the almost two years since its launch. Many drivers told us it was helpful in identifying themselves at night as Lyft drivers when passengers were trying to figure out which ride was theirs.</p><p>According to one driver we asked about a switch from the stache to the Amp, the hot pink glow-in-the-dark identifier would be missed but he thought the color-coded LED display made a lot more sense. He said he’d actually been waiting for something like that for a while — the original glowstache was supposed to eventually have the ability to change colors.</p><p>Like the original glowstache, the 7.8-inch by 2.1-inch display lights up to help riders see their car in the dark, but this time it beams in six different colors: teal, green, orange, silver, purple and yellow. Lyft randomizes the Amp color each time a rider hails a Lyft.</p><p>Riders can see which driver color to look for by going to the Lyft app and scrolling to the bottom, near where other details such as the car color or license plate are usually displayed.</p><p>Lyft’s software algorithm chooses the colors to help avoid confusion during busy events and riders can see the device displayed prominently on a driver’s dashboard. The rider’s phone will also light up with the corresponding color to help each driver identify their passenger.</p><p>A message like “Hello, Sarah” might also  display on the side facing the backseat of the car so passengers will see it when they are inside the vehicle.</p><p>Lyft hinted this messaging system might display company updates at some point. Amp might tell passengers every ride is 10 percent off that weekend, for example — but that won’t happen for awhile, says Lyft, and it won’t ever include outside advertising.</p><p>Could Lyft eventually add a GPS system to Amp to help drivers  — or a self-driving car — better pinpoint a rider? “Stay tuned,” Rappaport said when asked about the possibility. She also agreed it would help when the robot drivers took over.</p><p>“Absolutely it’s an extensible solution for in a world where there isn’t a driver in a car,” she said. It probably wouldn’t be hard technically to integrate GPS within the device as well.</p><p>Lyft didn’t want to say how much Amp cost to make, but the software is made in-house and the hardware is from a third-party manufacturer. Amp will, however, be free to all drivers and, unlike the glowstache, will be rolled out en-masse to all drivers in the locations the service is available.</p><p>The plan is to start delivering Amps to Lyft’s 315,000+ drivers before New Year’s Eve, starting with San Francisco, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</p><p>For more on how Amp works you can check out the video below, or just wait for one to show up on your ride sometime in the near future.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Artificial intelligence allows machines to reason and interact with the world, and it’s evolving at a breakneck pace. It’s already driving our cars, managing our health and even competing with — and sometimes beating at our on games — our best and most talented humans.</p><p>Many advances in AI can be attributed to machine learning, which works by tapping massive computing power to crunch through enormous amounts of digitized data. Now consider that most of our data, the best minds in the business and more computing power than you could ever imagine sit with just a handful of companies. For these reasons, only a few companies in the world are best situated to understand the true potential — and the current limits — of AI.</p><p>In response to AIs rapid developments, more than 8,000 leading researchers and scientists — including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking — have signed an open letter alluding to AI’s potential pitfalls and possible detriment to humanity. Their main concern is that an existential risk faces humanity: an AI in control of autonomous weapons.</p><p>The letter goes on to state that autonomous weapons are quickly becoming the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms, and that AI researchers must focus their research on what is beneficial for humanity, and not just what is profitable. However, much of what is researched with AI may not be public knowledge, and is likely internal research that’s closely held by just a few very wealthy corporations. How can the public make informed decisions about something that is kept secret?</p><p>Luckily, there are many who are willing to help us understand the current and future potential of AI for the benefit of humanity. These folks include recent nonprofits such as The Future of Life Institute and OpenAI, with notable donors including Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. OpenAI’s mission is:</p><p>…to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact.</p><p>OpenAI’s technical goals go on to state that they are out to solve a general AI, or an AI that can perform any task, and perhaps develop a body to go along with it. They’ve hired many notable AI experts, and raised $1 billion in investment in 2015.</p><p>OpenAI certainly has the talent to move things forward, but can a nonprofit really keep up with massive corporate innovation? If so, they’ll need to excel at the two major developments that have made machine learning a success: the exponential increase in computing power, and access to massive amounts of data.</p><p>To help provide access to the computing power, they’ll need, NVIDIA, a graphics chip manufacturer specializing in optimized ML hardware and software, that just delivered their first supercomputer to OpenAI — a $129,000 machine known as the world’s first deep learning supercomputer in a box.</p><p>Of course, it’s not hard to imagine that Google, Microsoft, Amazon or Facebook have many more orders of magnitudes of computing power than any one machine could have. That’s not to suggest that these corporations are hiding their computing power. Instead, Google for example, has open-sourced its AI library, called TensorFlow, and is quickly scaling its online cloud computing platform to enable access to state of the art equipment to include clusters of NVIDIA hardware.</p><p>The barbell effect of machine learning</p><p>Is Singularity Near?</p><p>'Appocalypse,' Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love AI</p><p>Artificial Intelligence Nonprofit OpenAI Launches With Backing From Elon Musk And Sam Altman</p><p>More worrisome for OpenAI than keeping up with corporate computing power, however, is being able to access the same data. Every ML algorithm requires data to learn — enough data to generalize well enough to the scope of the population. Plenty of data sets for ML have been available since the early 1990s. However, it’s only in the last few years that our digital sharing economy has enabled mass collection of our personal data and behaviors, something an AI needs in order to learn. OpenAI, on the other hand, has no users to mine for data, so it must rely solely on open data sources.</p><p>Another potential concern is that OpenAI is co-chaired by Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator. Will their own companies take advantage of an all-star AI research team with billions of dollars in funding? And will OpenAI employees even care if they are given stock options in Y Combinator and soon SpaceX?</p><p>Regardless of potential pitfalls, OpenAI is the only nonprofit organization dedicating itself to the humane development of AI. Now that AI is becoming more general, its developments are already surprising us. A nonprofit led by the brightest minds sounds like exactly what the world needs to help us understand the future of AI, and to lead the way toward a positive impact on society.</p><p>Rather than a corporate-driven scenario, where AI could be used for the financial advantage of a select few, the nonprofit recognizes the potential for AI to develop a better future for all. That includes medical applications that will save lives, cars that will reduce accidents and a general AI that can benefit humanity.</p>",

Released by Telltale Games in association with NBCUniversal, and developed by Night School Studio in collaboration with Universal Cable Productions, the game is played through the fictional E-Corp messaging app, allowing players to communicate in real time with characters in the show.</p><p>The game continues the show’s technically correct naming scheme, too. While episodes of the show are often titled with names referencing video files, like .avi or .flv, for example, the iOS game is called Mr. Robot: 1.51exfiltrati0n.ipa — the .ipa referring to the iOS application archive file format.

    "content": "<p>What innovations are you most excited about right now?</p><p>My guess is that when you’re scrolling through tech blogs or Product Hunt, you’re probably clicking on the most buzzworthy technology or trendiest social media app before a new consumer product.</p><p>And that’s understandable: How do you get excited about a new snack food or laundry detergent when virtual reality, artificial intelligence and autonomous cars dominate the news? It’s easy: Because consumer goods impact every facet of our lives, from our personal health and comfort to how we socialize with each other and care for our environment.</p><p>Americans may spend a staggering 50 minutes per day checking Facebook, but we interact with consumer products even more frequently than social media. Every day, we each spend more than two hours preparing and eating food, seven hours sleeping on a mattress and nearly 24 hours wearing clothes (well, most of us anyway).</p><p>And incredible things are happening across all these categories. You just have to pay attention.</p><p>Food is undergoing such a transformation that many product labels bear little resemblance to their predecessors of decades past. Whether lab-grown, like Ava’s wine or Impossible Foods‘ meat patties, produced from plants, like Hampton Creek’s mayonnaise or Ripple’s milk, or made from insect flour, like Exo’s protein bars, ingredients are definitely not what they used to be.</p><p>And that’s a huge improvement for our bodies, our environment and our wallets. Reducing animal-based ingredients and using protein-rich alternatives isn’t just more sustainable, it’s a lot cheaper and healthier.</p><p>Does Gillette know your name? Probably not, even if you’ve purchased hundreds of their razors from your local pharmacy over the years.</p><p>But you can bet Dollar Shave Club does. As commerce shifts from wholesale to a direct-to-consumer model, companies are using their relationship with you to create a superior customer experience at a lower cost. By actually getting to know you, startups can build truly bespoke experiences and products, such as The Black Tux’s tailored tuxedos or Julep’s skin-specific beauty boxes.</p><p>Consumers who have come to expect near-instant gratification and thoughtful UX design from tech products like Uber and Snapchat are now getting that same level of convenience and personalization from their consumer products.</p><p>Like most next-gen consumers, urbanites are clamoring for fresh, local food. Historically, they’ve resorted to highly processed, low-nutrient industrial products shipped from distant farms, but now vertical farming — a technique that grows food in vertical stacks — is making it easy to get fresh produce to everyone.</p><p>Last month, Square Roots launched an urban farming accelerator to encourage the next generation of “real food” entrepreneurs. Farming is suddenly becoming “cool” again, and the rising number of agricultural scientists are already finding inventive new ways to feed our growing cities as the population continues to shift from rural to urban areas.</p><p>More than 90 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are white men. Is it any wonder, then, that consumer products have historically been geared to that same demographic? Fortunately, times are changing — albeit slowly — and more diverse founders are democratizing the goods their companies produce.</p><p>The success of startups like Walker & Company, which makes health and beauty products for African-Americans, has proven that goods geared toward minorities are in high demand.  Similarly, feminine hygiene products didn’t evolve for decades until female founders finally got access to capital and disrupted the category. Now THINX and LOLA are providing convenience, comfort and cost efficiency to half the world’s population.</p><p>While your grandmother might be shocked that you’re willing to pay $5.99 for a gallon of organic milk, the costs of many consumer staples have actually been falling for the past few decades. The inflation-adjusted price of milk, for example, is 50 percent lower today than it was 40 years ago.</p><p>Price might not be the sexiest topic — particularly when stacked against cars that can literally drive themselves — but it can have a big impact on our day-to-day lives. Just 30 years ago, Americans were spending nearly 30 percent of their income on consumer products. Now, that number is only 19 percent.</p><p>And yes, some of that change is because we’re making different choices (25-35-year-olds now spend more on data plans than personal services), but it’s also because many staples are just relatively less expensive than they used to be. Ongoing innovations, like the aforementioned foodtech revolution and the shift toward a direct-to-consumer model, increasingly free up more of your paycheck — so you might actually be able to afford that autonomous car some day.</p><p>If that’s not enough to inspire you — if you’re still more excited about tech than consumer goods, then I have good news: before long, the two categories will be virtually indistinguishable. In the words of Marc Andreessen, software is eating the world.</p><p>Is the Apple Watch a software device or a consumer product? What about an electric oven controlled by a mobile app? If a startup makes sneakers with built-in step trackers, are they an apparel manufacturer or a tech company? Software is no longer limited to cell phones and computers; it’s improving even centuries-old products.</p><p>Technology is inherently exciting. It inspires the hopeful, science fiction-loving futurist in all of us. But you spend all day, every day interacting with consumer products. Even marginal changes to those products can have an outsized impact on your quality of life. And the changes we’re seeing aren’t marginal. Products are changing so dramatically that you won’t even recognize your closet or pantry in another five to ten years. And that’s definitely something to get excited about.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Today at its F8 conference, Facebook announced its new Messenger Platform that will allow its 600 million users to create and share content with third-party tools, and communicate directly with businesses rather than calling or emailing them. The content tools platform and apps from initial partners including ESPN, JibJab, and Giphy, will become in an Messenger update available today. Facebook is working with a limited set of partners for business chat, which will roll out sometime in the future.</p><p>Facebook today released an SDK to help developers start building experiences for Messenger.</p><p>The announcement confirms my scoop from last week that Facebook would launch a Messenger Platform focused on content. Facebook Messenger head David Marcus tells me “In the West, it’s the first messaging platform at the scale of 600 million-plus users that’s opened up to developers.”</p><p>Facebook also launched a slew of new capabilities for Parse developers, advertisers, websites, and the News Feed. You can see all the announcements in our “Everything Facebook Launched At F8” page.</p><p>The Messenger content apps will be accessible from a triple-dot button in the composer next to options to add photos or stickers. Users will be able to get deeplinked into their phone’s app store to download these Messenger companion apps.</p><p>From there, users can create content like animated GIFs and special effects-laden videos, or discover content, and then instantly share it to friends through Messenger. Each piece of content sent through the platform includes an attribution link to what app it was made with. A recipient can click to download or open that app and reply with a piece of content.</p><p>Initial Messenger content app partners include ESPN, Bitmoji, JibJab, Legend, Ultratest, Ditty, Giphy, FlipLip, ClipDis, Memes, PicCollage, Kanvas, JJ Abrams’ studio Bad Robot’s Action Mobie FX, Boostr, Camoji, Cleo Video Texting, Clips, Dubsmash, Effectify, EmotionAR, EMU, Fotor, Gif Keyboard, GifJam, Hook’d, Imgur, Imoji, Keek, Magisto, Meme Generator, Noah Camera, Pic Stitch, PingTank, Score! on Friends, Selfied, Shout, StayFilm, Facebook Stickered, Strobe, Tackl, Talking Tom, Tempo, The Weather Channel, to.be Camera, and Wordeo.</p><p>Rather than add the functionality of these apps directly into Messenger, which might make it feel cluttered and confusing, Messenger platform apps are their own separate companion apps.</p><p>“If we added a 10th to the capabilities [directly to Messenger] that we’ve added with partners today, it would make it really slow” Marcus tells me. “If you don’t want to use those things, you’re not forced to…because those experiences don’t live inside of Messenger. It’s not like the overall experience of the app is getting very bloated.”</p><p>To select the partners, Marcus says Facebook employees starting testing creative expression apps, picked their favorites, and reached out. He says almost ever “almost every single one of them rose to the occasion and built something in record time for this.” And Marcus believes that since only users can send messages, not apps by themselves, spam won’t be a problem.</p><p>By creating more vivid ways to share, Messenger could differentiate itself from SMS and competing messaging apps like WeChat, Line, Kik, KakaoTalk, and Google’s messenger. While Facebook doesn’t monetize Messenger directly, usage drives lock-in with its social network and News Feed where it makes money by showing ads.</p><p>Facebook is also aiming to use Messenger to reinvent communication with businesses. The idea is that people hate touch-tone phone tree customer service calls. Endless email threads are annoying too. People would rather just text asynchronously in a single chat thread.</p><p>To allow that Facebook is working with an initial set of partners including Everlane and Zulily to change how people contact them. For example, if you buy something through Everlane, but want to modify, track, or return your order, you’ll be able to contact the business through Messenger.</p><p>And rather than getting individual emails about order confirmation and your order shipping, you’ll be able to opt to get those messages in Messenger.</p><p>Customer support will be permitted over Messenger thanks to an integration with ZenDesk. Businesses that already use live chat systems for customer support will be able to run that communication over Messenger.</p><p>Business will also be able to deliver push notifications to customers through Messenger, even if the merchant doesn’t have its own app. Businesses who want access to these features can apply here.</p><p>Not only could absorbing formerly clumsy customer-to-business communication drive platform lock-in, it could give Facebook valuable insight into commerce. The more Facebook knows about what you buy and what businesses you interact with, the better it can target its ads and tune its News Feed content.</p><p>As for what Facebook will do to monetize the business chat side of the platform, Marcus tells me “Right now, nothing. But I think that over time if we solve that problem for consumers, if we’re able to allow merchants and businesses to reach their customers in a better way and grow their businesses by doing that, we’ll figure out a good business model. It will be legitimate because we solve problems for both constituents.”</p><p>While Messenger’s platform could increase engagement with Facebook and help users express themselves and solve customer support problems, it could also have a huge impact on app developers.</p><p>Right now, the app stores are overrun with crap and it’s hard to find high-quality products. Messenger’s platform will create a curated way to discover great apps, giving developers the exposure they need to build their businesses.</p><p>Marcus explains that the two big problems the Messenger content app platform solves are “1. It’s not easy to discover apps, and 2. It’s normally hard to share.” Even if you have an app already, you have to go find and open it, create something, save it to your camera roll, then</p>",

    "content": "<p>Google gives publishers the ability to run display and text ads on their sites. They can run both styles of ads, or just pick a single one. The same goes for advertisers, who also have to choose between one of these two formats for their ads. Today, however, the company is launching a new ad unit that brings standard text ads to sites that would normally just run display ads.</p><p>These so-called “magazine-style” ads will only feature text, but will appear with “a design aesthetic suitable for display,” Google says.</p><p>It doesn’t look like there is any graphical wizardry involved here and Google doesn’t add any images to the ads. Instead, the company simply takes the text and reformats it into one of the larger ad units typically used for display ads, with a lot of whitespace around the text.</p><p>The idea here is to give text advertisers the ability to compete for space on display-only ad units and to give publishers the ability to run text-like ads on their sites that would normally only feature display ads. While Google recommends that publishers run both text and display ads on their sites to maximize their potential revenue, publishers often choose to just run the more visual display ads because they are more consistent with their design, for example.</p><p>These new ad types will appear whenever a text ad outbids a display ad, so the economic reasoning behind this move is pretty straightforward: Google can simply make more money when these magazine-style text ads appear instead of the usual display ad. Before, these text ads weren’t even in contention for these spots.</p><p>As the last quarter showed, Google’s ad prices are under substantial pressure — partially because of the general move to mobile and because it’s moving into more emerging markets where ad prices are lower. This new unit won’t move the needle all that much, but given the company’s size, even small changes can bring a few extra million dollars into the company’s coffers.</p>",

    "content": "<p>xAd, the ad network that serves you ads in apps and mobile web pages based on your location, is today announcing another hefty round of funding, as well as its first acquisition in the world of consumer apps to grow its audience and data set. The company has raised $42.5 million, and it’s buying WeatherBug, the popular weather app that competes with the likes of the Weather Channel app from The Weather Company (now owned by IBM).</p><p>xAd’s valuation is not being disclosed with this round, but CEO and founder Dipanshu Sharma told me in an interview that it’s “definitely an up-round.” The company had not disclosed its valuation in the past, either, but when it last raised money, a Series D of $50 million in 2014, xAd was valued at $250 million, according to one report.</p><p>As with that last round, this Series E was an opportunistic raise. Led by Eminence Capital and joined by W Capital, IVP and Emergence Capital (plus a large tech company that only wants to release its name tomorrow, we’ve been told), the investment comes at a time when xAd is already profitable. Sharma said xAd raised this in order to fund the acquisition of WeatherBug from previous owner Earth Networks.</p><p>That’s not to say that WeatherBug was a $42.5 million transaction — xAd is not releasing those terms, either, but Sharma told me it was more than this. The Series E brings the total raised by the company to $116.5 million.</p><p>The funding comes at a crossroads for the world of location services.</p><p>In the early days of smartphone use, the promise of location services was just that — a concept that people were still working on to make a reality. These days, location in apps is something we’ve come to expect to just work. At the same time, some have grown wary of location services: they can drain our batteries, they might feel intrusive and what data are they collecting, exactly?</p><p>xAd predicates its service on the idea that push-based notifications are indeed intrusive, and that the most effective location-based advertising is the kind that comes to you because you are already open to seeing something. “You’re already in the app experience,” Sharma said.</p><p>xAd works by using GPS signals within apps, server integrations and location requests if you have them turned on, but no Wi-FI (“we don’t touch WiFi”) and then, when you are in a particular location, and you open an add-based app or web page, xAd — which has negotiated placement in various mobile ad networks — will serve you an ad relevant to that location. It uses this formula to place ads in some 150,000 apps today.</p><p>This is where the WeatherBug acquisition will figure in more ways than one. The app is popular, consistently ranking within the top five downloads on iOS and top 10 on Android within weather apps, according to App Annie figures. xAd says that it had 20 million unique users per month. (xAd itself counts its reach by devices and places, respectively numbering 500 million and 100 million.) On a simple audience level, it gives xAd access to an audience that regularly checks the app, and tends to check it with locations in mind, meaning that advertising accuracy is guaranteed.</p><p>But WeatherBug will also give xAd a huge data trove that can be used in xAd’s wider platform, too.</p><p>When Earth Networks developed the app, it stood apart from a number of other weather apps in that it also built out a network of weather sensors that formed the basis of its weather updates and forecasts. Interestingly, those sensors are located globally even though WeatherBug was only marketed in the U. S.</p><p>xAd has not acquired those sensors, but it has picked up an extended license to use their data as part of the deal. And the plan will be to invest in a global rollout to tap into that network better, Sharma told me.</p><p>The weather data, he added, is a perfect complement to location and for providing more color that can help deliver more relevant marketing to users in particular locations. Weather and environment data and its many applications, of course, was a key reason behind IBM’s acquisition of The Weather Company, reportedly in a $2 billion deal.</p><p>This looks like it’s xAd’s second acquisition, although its first of a publisher property. (The first was back in 2011, mobile search and mobile ad assets from a company called Go2.)</p><p>Looking ahead, Sharma said that xAd plans to look at more of these. Sharma said that this is part of a long-term plan he and management and the board planned out some time ago, to acquire key apps that have strong use cases and audiences for location services. While he wouldn’t say what might be the next target, categories that might potentially also be included in such a strategy include fitness apps and mapping services.</p><p>And the bigger strategy behind this, he said, is to help xAd remain an independent player even as the likes of Facebook and Google ramp up with more location functionality in their own platforms and advertising, and many others continue their wider consolidation in the wider world of adtech.</p>",

    "content": "<p>At its MAX conference, Adobe today previewed Project Nimbus, a new cloud-native, Lightroom-like photo editor that takes away a lot of the complexity of Adobe’s flagship photo-managing and editing application and replaces it with simpler, smarter tools. For now, Adobe is sadly not releasing this tool to the public, but you can expect a beta next year.</p><p>In recent years, Adobe focused strongly on its mobile apps. In many ways, Project Nimbus brings a lot of what Adobe has learned from mobile back to the desktop.</p><p>As the company stressed during today’s demo, Nimbus is meant to work seamlessly with the rest of its tools. It shares the same cloud-based image and asset library as the rest of its Creative Cloud suite and image edits are non-destructive and reflected across applications. Indeed, one of the main design philosophies behind Nimbus is that users should be able to seamlessly move back and forth between the desktop and mobile.</p><p>The tool also makes use of Adobe’s new machine learning-based services. That means you will be able to use natural language to find images in your library, for example. That’s similar to what Google is doing with Google Photos, for example, but in Lightroom, you always had to tag your photos if you wanted to find them again. Similarly, Adobe is using some of its cloud-based Creative SDK and Adobe Sensei artificial intelligence service to power features like Nimbus’ photo retouching tools.</p><p>It’s clear that Adobe believes the way forward is to give its users the option to work on their projects across devices and applications. It’s already been doing that with its mobile apps and it’s now starting to bring what it has learned on those platforms back to the desktop, too.</p><p>Project Nimbus itself still feels like a bit of an odd product, though, especially given how similar many of the features — and even some of the layouts — are to Lightroom. It’s not hard to imagine that Adobe could position Nimbus (or whatever it will call it when it finally launches it) as a more consumer-oriented version of Lightroom. But in some ways, it almost feels like the kernel of a next-gen version of Lightroom that could actually replace the older tool in the long run.</p><p>Oh — and just to confuse things, this is Adobe’s second Project Nimbus.</p>",

Project VoCo lets you edit speech as easily as text — and you can’t just edit existing text, you can even use the same voice model to create completely new recordings, too.</p><p>Here is how this works: Project VoCo needs about 20 minutes of voice samples from a given speaker. It then analyzes the speech, breaks it down into phonemes, transcribes it and creates the voice model. If you listen closely, you can hear when a word has changed, but it’s probably only a matter of time before you won’t be able to distinguish the actual recording and the edited (or completely fake) one.</p><p>As Adobe noted in today’s demo during a small press event at MAX, the project isn’t based on traditional speech synthesis technology but on what Adobe calls “voice conversion.” What’s especially interesting here is that there’s almost no manual intervention necessary. You can always correct the auto-generated transcript to improve the synthesis, but there’s no need to set timestamps, for example. The algorithms can figure that out themselves.</p><p>This technology raises all kinds of questions. What happens if you can’t even trust what sounds like a genuine recording of somebody’s speech anymore? From a purely technical standpoint, though, this is some pretty impressive stuff.</p><p>At the same press event, Adobe also showed off two other new editing projects: Project Quick Layout for — as the name kind of implies — making it easier to edit print layouts, and Project Clover, a VR editing tool that works right inside of VR.</p><p>As with all of these “Sneak Peeks,” Adobe won’t commit to ever shipping them, but over the years, many of the projects it has introduced this way have made their way into the company’s products.</p>",

    "content": "<p>It’s November 11 — 11/11, or Singles’ Day — which is China’s biggest shopping day. A day for records. A big promotion day for Alibaba, which surpassed its sales total from last year’s event hours before it closed, despite overall growth slowing.</p><p>This year, Alibaba marked Single’s Day — the planet biggest online shopping event — with a splashy four-hour show in Shenzhen which include appearances from Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson, ex-England footballer David Beckham, retired NBA player Kobe Bryant, and live music from OneRepublic. Company founder Jack Ma even presented a magic trick on stage.</p><p>On the business side of things, GMV, the metric to measure the total value of merchandise sold across Alibaba’s online stores, hit $14.3 billion last year. That figure was beaten in Chinese Yuan before 3:30 pm, while the U. S. Dollar metric was beaten before 8:00 pm when GMV reached $14.69 billion, or RMB 100 million. (You can put that down to changing overseas currency rates.)</p><p>For some perspective: Black Friday, the U. S. shopping event around Thanksgiving, reached $4.5 billion in GMV last year, while Cyber Monday — another top U.S. shopping date — crossed a record $3 billion in 2015. Alibaba claimed its GMV topped $1 billion just 4 minutes and 54 seconds into the sale, and growth over the last few years has certainly been remarkable.</p><p>“Back in 2013, RMB 35 billion was our one-day GMV. Now we can achieve it in one hour,” CEO Daniel Zhang, who invented the Single’s Day concept in 2009 when he led Alibaba’s T-Mall business, said in a statement.</p><p>But there’s more to it.</p><p>Alibaba has come under pressure from regulators over the way it measures Single’s Day, with the SEC launching an investigation into “accounting practices” this summer. Alibaba doesn’t take a cut of sales from its merchants — the GMV figure — instead charging for advertising. That makes the GMV figures, while impressive, somewhat of a distraction from the actual revenue it is pulling in. That’s important because there has been much chatter about slowing economic conditions — which haven’t affected Alibaba yet — while the company is putting emphasis on new markets like India and Southeast Asia to offset concerns around growth potential in China.</p><p>Total sales reached $17.79 billion by the end of the day. Single’s Day GMV jumped 60 percent from RMB 57.1 billion (then $9.3 billion) to RMB 91.2 billion (then $14.3 billion) between 2014 and 2015, and this year’s figure represented a lower 32 percent increase on last year. However, the figures don’t include returns which could be as high as 30 percent, analysts told the New York Times.</p><p>What’s particularly interesting about the sale, is the high volume of money being spent on mobile. As of 1pm China time, mobile represented 84 percent of all sales. That rate has slowly decreased as the day as gone on, probably because of a surge in people using their smartphones when the sale opened at midnight, but it is on course to be significantly higher than 11/11 201, when mobile was 69 percent of GMV. In the U. S., mobile is typically below 35 percent of sales on shopping bonanza dates.</p><p>Alibaba rolled out support for VR in the week leading up to 11/11 to allow users to shop “virtually” in department stores like Macy’s from the comfort of wherever the are. The concept is still new, but no doubt it will become a more prevalent and important medium for Alibaba as virtual reality and augmented reality gain a foothold among increasing numbers of consumers. It could also help Alibaba broaden its reach into international markets.</p><p>On that note, Alibaba said that over 14,000 “international brands” are taking part in is sale, and that they account for around one-third of sales. Apple, Adidas, Nike, Siemens and Uniqlo are among the top sellers, it said. But this is Alibaba, and Chinese brands are also cashing in on the company’s increased globalization and international reach, with consumers in some 207 countries buying items in the Single’s Day sale.</p><p>“The demand for international products continues to be very strong, the value proposition for Chinese consumers for international products continues to be enormous,” Alibaba Group President Michael Evans said.</p>",

S. businesses that suffer if President-elect Donald Trump plays hardball with China over trade.</p><p>That’s according to an editorial from China’s state-run newspaper Global Times this weekend — via The Guardian — which included a thinly-veiled threat of repercussions if Trump takes action on pre-election comments. In September, Trump said he would impose a 45 percent tariff on imports from China if successfully elected.</p><p>Like many of Trump’s campaign comments, it remains to be seen what the incoming President’s policy will be. That hasn’t stopped the Global Times, one of China’s most notable government mouthpieces, from giving its take, however.</p><p>“China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U. S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” the paper wrote.</p><p>Global Times suggested that it is “a win-win situation” for all to maintain current agreements, and that there is too much at stake to do otherwise.</p><p>“Trump as a shrewd businessman will not be so naïve. None of the previous presidents were bold enough to launch an all-out trade war against China. They all opted for a cautious line since it’s most consistent with the overall interests of the U. S., and it’s most acceptable to U.S. society,” the editorial added.</p><p>The editorial was published right after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping communicated for the first time following the election result. Chinese media reported that the two have made plans to meet “at an early date.”</p><p>Apple, with its global reputation and vast wealth, is a popular target for politics. Trump has made choice comments on Apple and China in the past, demanding that the iPhone-maker produce its devices in its homeland rather than overseas. He also called for a boycott of its products after it rejected government requests to unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.</p><p>In a memo to staff sent after last week’s election, Apple CEO Tim Cook urged employees to “move forward together” in spite of the political division in America right now. Cook didn’t make mention of Trump by name, nor did he address the President-elect’s past comments about Apple.</p>",

The program has about 4000 developers today, and GE is hoping for 20,000 by next year —  although the vast majority of these will be from GE and its ISV partners for now.</p><p>This is very much like the Salesforce 1 approach to development where Salesforce has provided a platform and companies have built custom solutions and entire businesses on top of it. GE is likely looking at a much more modest uptake with its platform, but it is a similar idea.</p><p>Today’s announcement comes on the heels of the company’s August news that it would be offering Infrastructure services to developers on Predix as well. That was a bold move in a crowded market, but GE is trying to offer a soup-to-nuts menu of industrial cloud services. This is similar in some ways to IBM’s cloud strategy with SoftLayer for infrastructure, Bluemix for developers and a portfolio of SaaS products as well.</p><p>To fill in that last piece, GE is also offering some industrial software packages on top of Predix to prime the development pump. These include Brilliant Factory and Digital Power Plant, two products designed to help squeeze more efficiencies out these verticals Both products were announced today at Minds + Machines.</p><p>These two tools are part of new generation of software that is using big data to make industrial workflows more efficient. In the case of the power plant software, it reads information from sensors and other sources and based on that data provides ways to generate more electricity from the same equipment.</p><p>“We are connecting real-time controls and sub-systems and creating models for optimizing [the system]. We use sensor data, then work against models and adjust controls in real time based on that,” Bill Ruh, vice president and global technology director at General Electric told TechCrunch.</p><p>He claims that using this suite of tools, the company has been able to squeeze out 20 percent more electricity from wind turbine farms running the software.</p><p>Brilliant Factories does something similar for factories, looking at the body of data, comparing it against a model and getting the maximum amount of usage out of machines. GE developed these tools for its own factories and is now making it available for customers, Ruh said.</p><p>The software helps factory managers by sending warnings when data shows an imminent part or machine failure, so they can plan accordingly. It also helps optimize the job scheduling based on factors such as how much pressure the equipment can take.</p><p>In fact, Ruh says companies running this software can expect $230 million in savings per plant over 20 years, which if true is obviously significant.</p><p>Finally, GE is announcing more capability around Wurldtech , the security company it bought last year. The company is protecting more than 4000 wind turbines, gas pipelines and similar industrial equipment from cyber attack. These kinds of equipment require a different kind of protection from the datacenter, Ruh said.</p><p>This bushel of announcements is meant to showcase Predix’s capabilities. GE is hoping that as it builds out the platform, it can begin to rely on it as a growing source of business. It sees big growth ahead, predicting business will triple to $15 billion in revenue by 2020.</p>",

He understood the power of online money transfers well before most traditional financial institutions. He wrote Facebook a check when it was little more than an interesting startup from another Harvard dropout. Most recently, he anticipated what few of his peers predicted could possibly come to fruition: a Trump presidency.</p><p>Of course, Thiel more than recognized that Trump’s ascendancy was unstoppable. He spoke out publicly on Trump’s behalf, including in a keynote speech at the Republican National Conventional. He also donated to Trump’s campaign.</p><p>If Trump retreated back to the world of reality television and his real estate dealings after this year’s election, as was widely expected to happen, Silicon Valley and the rest of the business world would eventually forget about Thiel’s ringing endorsement of Trump. As distance grew between Trump’s political aspirations and his ability to initiate global annihilation, the tech community would have been increasingly willing to forgive and forget.</p><p>Instead, Trump is now President-elect of the United States of America. And no matter what your position on that outcome – whether you consider him a genius for acknowledging an angry republic and for cutting his way to the most powerful office in the world virtually single-handedly, or you deem him a shallow narcissist who has repeatedly displayed contempt for women, minorities, civility, and critical thinking — he is wholly inexperienced as a politician.

    "content": "<p>Facebook’s plot for ad domination is coming to fruition. Today at Facebook headquarters, its ad execs explained how two years of seemingly isolated launches and acquisitions are melding into a powerful way to show ads across the Internet and track the purchases they inspire both online and offline.</p><p>Here’s how the pieces come together:</p><p>Facebook brings its 1.35 billion users and massive engagement with the News Feed where it shows its ads. Because its huge user base stays logged in across web and mobile, it has a unified understanding of people’s identities in a way most platforms don’t. Facebook’s wealth of personal data means it can target ads more accurately. For instance, it says it can target gender with 90 percent accuracy compared to the online ad industry average of 50 percent.</p><p>Tracking online purchases inspired by its ad clicks is easy, but what’s more difficult is understanding offline purchase behavior.</p><p>So Facebook built what’s called Custom Audiences, which lets businesses upload their purchase data and identifying information about their customers to Facebook in a hashed, privacy-protected way. Facebook can both use this to let businesses target ads to their existing customers, but also to reference them against who saw ads to prove that impressions on web or mobile, even without clicks, lead to purchases.</p><p>Facebook also collects offline purchase data tied to people’s grocery loyalty cards and other identifiers through partners like Datalogix. The point of all this measurement is that when advertisers can see they’re getting a return on investment, they spend more.</p><p>This all worked great on Facebook, but the company saw a huge opportunity to bring this to the rest of the web. So in February 2013, Facebook acquired Microsoft’s Atlas, a suite of tools for online ad measurement. This let Facebook bring its understanding of cross-device ROI to ads across the web run through Atlas.</p><p>As for publishers, the websites and apps that host ads, Facebook saw video content becoming more popular. Many publishers were working with a video adtech platform called LiveRail that connects them to video advertisers and targets the little commercials. So Facebook acquired LiveRail for around $500 million in July 2014.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook had built and launched Audience Network, a mobile ad network that lets advertisers easily extend their Facebook ad campaigns to appear in other mobile apps. This gave Facebook the connective tissue to tie the other pieces together.</p><p>Advertisers on Atlas can easily buy ads on Facebook or use Audience Network to extend their campaigns to LiveRail and mobile apps.</p><p>“We think we’re revolutionizing measurement,” says Facebook’s VP Of Ad Tech Brian Boland.</p><p>The subtext of today’s session was that Facebook thinks it’s ready to soak up the flood of ad dollars starting to slosh off of television and into digital. Facebook will have to battle Google and YouTube, Yahoo, AOL (TechCrunch’s parent company), and Twitter for that ad spend. Atlas’ David Jakubowski says “We know Google’s working pretty hard on this exact thing [cross-device, online/offline measurement]. We expect they’ll do something in this space.”</p><p>But if the social network can prove its scale, targeting, and measurement surpass its competitors, Madison Avenue might agree that Facebook is the successor to TV.</p><p>Why LiveRail Ditched An IPO To Sell Its Video AdTech To Facebook For ~$500M</p>",

    "content": "<p>Consumer virtual reality has a clear new leader today, and it’s the just-launched PlayStation VR. Unequivocally, this is the best VR experience currently available outside of the kinds of high-flying, super-secret test rigs that exist out there for army training or whatever that cost millions of dollars. That includes top-of-line hardware like HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, as well as smartphone standouts like Samsung Gear VR.</p><p>I own the HTC Vive, and I’m not abandoning it by any means. I also have and use Gear VR, and I’m excited to explore Daydream VR further, after getting a small taste of it at Google’s Pixel launch event. And if you’re looking for an assessment of which VR hardware you, personally, should buy, Lucas has that covered with his roundup. But despite all of that, it’s clear to me that PlayStation VR is the new gold standard when it comes to consumer VR, and could go a long way to proving that the technology is accessible and viable for everyday users.</p><p>Is PSVR perfect? Not at all — the visual fidelity and room-scale VR are both better on my HTC Vive. Plus, it doesn’t have the wireless freedom you get from Gear VR. I’ve even noticed some tracking issues where the PlayStation camera seems to lose sight of the headset temporarily, leading to disorienting jitters in the immersive experience.</p><p>But what PlayStation VR offers is simplicity — from setup, to calibration, to actual use, the experience is very similar to what you’ve experienced before setting up any new console. It’s definitely due partly to having gone through the process of setting up much more complicated systems, including Vive, but unboxing and using PSVR consistently results in a “that’s it?” response from my brain, which is tuned to expect more hassle leading up to the actual VR stuff itself.</p><p>Simplicity alone isn’t enough, however, and the PSVR manages the right balance between simple and powerful, giving an end-user experience that’s as likely to wow the average person as is a high-end Vive or SteamVR game, but without the high-end technical requirements or comfort level with tech.</p><p>The other reason PlayStation VR wins is because of game selection. At launch, the game library is impressive already, and the best part of it is that all the experiences deserve to be there. Not all of them are necessarily amazing, but all the ones I’ve tried have impacted my overall opinion of VR for the better. That’s definitely not true of everything I’ve tried on the Vive, or on Gear VR.</p><p>If PSVR has a significant remaining issue, it’s that it’s still too expensive; despite not reaching the stratospheric pricing of Vive or Oculus, especially when you factor in the cost of the PC, PlayStation VR’s price tag is likely too high to attract much of a crowd beyond the core gamer group. But it’ll live in households where it’s much more likely to be exposed to a range of different kinds of users, which is exactly what VR needs right now.</p>",

    "content": "<p>An alleged former Google employee has anonymously published unconfirmed allegations that AdSense purposefully banned publishers right before their periodic payout so it could keep their ad revenue. But Google denies this as “a complete fiction”, and based on our examination of the report, the allegations look false. There may have been mechanisms in place to prevent scamming publishers this way, and linguistic clues suggest the author didn’t work at Google.</p><p>At our request, Google provided TechCrunch with this statement strongly denying the accusations:</p><p>“This description of our AdSense policy enforcement process is a complete fiction. The color-coding and ‘extreme quality control’ programs the author describes don’t exist. Our teams and automated systems work around the clock to stop bad actors and protect our publishers, advertisers and users.</p><p>The report doesn’t include hard evidence, and the whole thing might just be from a jilted publisher or someone else out to harm Google. Still, it could spark an investigation into AdSense’s banning procedure or at least a loss of confidence amongst AdSense publishers even if it’s untrue.</p><p>The whistleblower purports to have worked at Google since at least 2009, and says they waited until their identity could be concealed before coming forward. They wrote on Pastebin, “To sum it up for everyone, I took part in what I (and many others) would consider theft of money from the publishers by Google, and from direct orders of management.”</p><p>The full document is a bit meandering so here are the major points.</p><p>According to the source, Google experienced some financial department stumbles in 2009 and decided it “needed to tighten the belts”. The perception was that Google was writing too many and too large of checks to publishers, so it sought to curtail them. To do this, it implemented a new “quality control” initiative to ban publishers making more than $5,000 per month from AdSense, starting with a wave of bans in March 2009.</p><p>What alarmed the supposed employee is that “We were told to begin banning accounts that were close to their payout period…The purpose was to get that money owed to publishers back to Google AdSense, while having already served up the ads to the public.” This way, Google would get paid by the advertisers, run their ads on the publishers’ properties, but then ban the publisher right before they were to receive their payout for showing the ads, and Google would keep the money, he alleged.</p><p>Google employees were supposedly told that “it was needed for the company, and that most of these publishers were ripping Google off anyways, and that their gravy train needed to end.” Employees who didn’t go along with the plan were ridiculed for not being team players, and some resigned, the employee said.</p><p>Next, Google supposedly wanted to further automate the process, so it set up the “AdSense Quality Control Color Codes” system which identified lucrative publishers to ban, and protected larger corporations and anyone else who could hurt Google with negative press or by drumming up anti-AdSense sentiment amongst publishers.</p><p>Finally, the whistleblower suggests that Google was aware of a practice known as “Click-Bombing”, where a publisher would repeatedly over-click the ads of a competitor to get it flagged and banned by Google’s fraud system for self-clicking.</p><p>Obviously, someone aiming to hurt Google could get a lot of mileage by publishing these allegations. That motive led us to closely analyze the document for any red flags. We found many.</p><p>First, the language. The author refers to Google’s “AdSense division” rather than its official internal title “Online Sales And Operations”. He refers to “being a team player”, but down in Mountain View they call that “being Googley”. He also refers to “invalid clicks” which are much more commonly known as “click spam” at Google. “Click bombing” is a term that wasn’t used internally, we’ve heard, and only makes up a fraction of all invalid clicks.</p><p>The report also makes a lot of claims about the problems with these so-called ‘invalid clicks,” And while it’s true that competitors will sometimes click another’s ads, Google’s detection system is actually fairly sophisticated. It can tell when clicks are from the publishers themselves, which will get them banned, but it can also tell when the clicks come from a novice Internet user, in which case it will disregard some of the clicks but not all. And it can also tell when they come from some other malicious party, and it then disregards those clicks across all Google publishers.</p><p>Then there’s the functional discrepancies. AdSense’s billing is believed to require a publisher to be paid for an advertiser to be billed. That would block Google’s ability to charge an advertiser but not pay the publisher. Google’s policies explain that if a publisher is suspended for policy violations, “Payment for the 60 days prior to the disabling will be withheld and the money will be returned to impacted advertisers.”</p><p>The report also states that employees wanting to use AdSense on their websites were “automatically placed in the Green Group” which the poster refers to as VIP Status or the “untouchables.” That’s not quite the case. In reality, any Google employees with an AdSense account would have to get VP approval to use AdSense on their sites, and those accounts would then be heavily scrutinized.</p><p>And the biggest inconsistency of all is simply that this strategy for making money in the short term would decimate Google’s long-term revenue potential. Why would Google sacrifice all future earnings from a publisher just to snatch a month or one billing period worth of revenue? The economics just don’t add up. Google works with more than 2 million publishers and paid out $9 billion last year. Burning those publishers for a quick revenue hit just doesn’t make sense.</p><p>With so much pointing to the whistleblower not being a Google employee and the whole scheme being dysfunctional, i</p>",

    "content": "<p>As the Internet of Things (IoT) evolves toward becoming one of the fastest expanding sectors in the tech industry, a lot of focus is being given to greenfield development, the process of creating new devices from scratch. Many companies and startups are rushing to ship new connected products to store shelves in order to secure a share of this growing market.</p><p>Meanwhile, the greater potential lies in brownfield development, the integration of connectivity and data collection into things and designs that already exist. But unfortunately, because of the obstacles that lie in its path, brownfield IoT development is moving at a much slower pace than it should, which can effectively hold back the industry from leveraging its enormous possibilities and present potential challenges and difficulties for the IoT industry as a whole.</p><p>Greenfield development is conceptually easier than brownfield, which is why it is being embraced by so many IoT adopters and manufacturers. “You have a clean sheet of paper, you can design from scratch, and pick whatever tools you want to build your product,” says Joe Britt, CEO of Afero.</p><p>Greenfield manifests itself in the flood of new connected gadgets and devices that are being shipped to store shelves and put on display in consumer electronics shows. Because for the most part, these products and their manufacturers have no precedence, there are no constraints, limits or predefined parameters in their development and production.</p><p>The same can’t be said of the well-established product categories and manufacturers, which already have production lines that have been working and evolving for years and decades. “For example, air conditioners are typically produced by established manufacturers,” says Britt. “A given manufacturer will have been building different models for years, and will have a number of proprietary internal designs (or chassis) to draw upon when a new model is needed.”</p><p>Such a manufacturer will want newer models to draw from the legacy chassis as much as possible, in order to shorten development time and leverage investment already made in previous iterations. Modifications will be much easier to make for the design teams because past QA and testing efforts are at their disposal.</p><p>The same applies to Industrial IoT (IIoT), in which you must deal with a lot of machinery and infrastructure that already exists, such as roads, bridges, buildings, factories, power plants, oil rigs, etc. where replacements can cost millions of dollars.</p><p>That is why established manufacturers are more inclined toward incremental development and the desire to change as little as possible. “The manufacturer will prefer to find a solution which is additive rather than one which requires the replacement of core subsystems of the design,” Britt explains. “Established product developers that want to make their current production lines ‘smart’ don’t want to throw away all that IP and start from scratch — it’s too valuable.”</p><p>Brownfield developers inherit hardware, embedded software and tool decisions that limit the flexibility of their design and development process. Many of those legacy components were made before the age of the internet, or weren’t designed with connectivity in mind, which makes the transition to IoT even more challenging.</p><p>And, perhaps more importantly, most of these manufacturers don’t have the know-how and experience to develop for connected environments, and often overlook very important issues that go beyond connectivity, including security, scalability and interoperability.</p><p>“To achieve success in brownfield development, IoT companies will need to provide an easy, reliable solution that doesn’t intrude upon the design of the product,” Britt adds.</p><p>Developers need tools, platforms and standards that enable them to securely and efficiently connect their products to the cloud without the need to rely on proprietary resources.</p><p>Britt underlines the need for an end-to-end platform that takes care of the hardware and software underpinnings of IoT connectivity, security and interoperability, so that developers can focus on the core functionality of their products without the need to reinvent the wheel. This is an approach that can benefit both greenfield and brownfield development processes and help unify the currently dispersed and fragmented IoT landscape.</p><p>This is the vision behind Afero’s namesake IoT platform, which constitutes a set of desktop and mobile apps, hardware, development tools, connectivity modules and cloud services and APIs with which the components of an IoT ecosystem can be defined, identified, monitored and interconnected. As Britt explains it, the idea is to “boil down concepts into high-level building blocks that any developer or enthusiast can immediately use.”</p><p>Afero is a fairly new platform and company, coming out of stealth in late 2015, but it has already managed to secure $20.3 million in a new round of funding within a few months of its launch. According to Britt, Afero has partnered with companies to use its flagship platform in a number of greenfield and brownfield IoT projects, ranging from connected toys and medical devices to detecting water leaks and sensing buildings and infrastructure.</p><p>While holistic platforms will pave the way for easier brownfield IoT development, provisions also need to be made to integrate support for open standards in order to make possible interoperability and coexistence between different platforms and devices.</p><p>IBM Watson IoT is one of the companies that is taking strides in this field, encouraging and helping industries to adopt open standards, especially in the field of Industrial and Enterprise IoT. “In some industries, manufacturers are building things for IoT and we help them to consider open standards and interfaces and to create new ways to interact with their things,” says Bret Greenstein, vice president at IBM Watson IoT.</p><p>One of the ways IBM helps integration is through Node-RED, a visual wir</p>",

    "content": "<p>Facebook’s advertising network is already a colossal business — it helped the social network bring in over $5 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter alone — but it is about to take a step towards become the internet’s advertising exchange after announcing that it will start showing ads to non-users across the web..</p><p>Previously, if you were either not a Facebook user or not logged into the social network, then Facebook advertising on third party websites or mobile apps — powered by the Facebook Audience Network — would not be visible to you. That all changes today.</p><p>With more than 1.6 billion active users who share a range of personal information through its service, Facebook has built a formidable advertising business that enables companies to drill down into granular detail when targeting the audience they want to reach. That’s changed the game for generating interest in websites, services, app downloads or really anything online. While Facebook’s Audience Network has enabled it to extend that reach outside of Facebook to let advertisers find Facebook users while they are not inside the social network, today’s subtle move could hand advertisers the power to reach even more people.</p><p>According to the Wall Street Journal, Facebook will use a mix of cookie tracking, its own buttons and plugins and other data to identify non-users on third-party websites. Added to that data, Facebook will use patterns within its massive userbase to make educated guesses about non-users to help target them with more relevant advertising.</p><p>For example, why are they on this particular website, what interests and hobbies might they have, etc. These details are essential to replicating the very precise Facebook ad targeting with those who don’t have a Facebook account. If hundreds of thousands of Facebook users who also visited a site are interested in a particular type of clothing or app, or respond well to a specific kind of marketing, Facebook could use that insight to boost the relevance of ads pointed at non-users who visited that site — both immediately and later since the cookies follow them.</p><p>“Because we have a core audience of over a billion people [on Facebook] who we do understand, we have a greater opportunity than other companies using the same type of mechanism,” Andrew Bosworth, VP of Facebook’s ads and business platform, told the Journal.</p><p>Bosworth believes that, beyond offering more targeted outreach for advertisers, Facebook’s knowledge of internet users and advertising practices can benefit users by cutting down on poor quality advertising.</p><p>“Advertising may be here to stay, but bad advertising… doesn’t have to. That’s why we’re working to provide a better online advertising experience for everyone: people, publishers, and advertisers,” he wrote in a blog post.</p><p>“While more than a hundred companies already serve interest-based advertising on websites and apps today, we offer a better experience because we care about the integrity of Facebook ads,” Bosworth added. That includes refusing to run ads that auto-play sound or use frustrating pop-ups.</p><p>This move could be hugely pivotal for Facebook. Not only does it is further evidence that the company is keen to establish itself as the world’s premier video platform — which has some seriously money when it comes to advertising, not to mention tough competition from the likes of YouTube — by appealing beyond its social network, it also raises some tantalizing possibilities for the future.</p><p>Back when Facebook began testing off-network advertising in 2012, TechCrunch’s resident Facebook reporter Josh Constine wrote about the potential for an ad-free experience on the social network. It would essentially use its main properties to collect data and provide a consistently enjoyable experience, instead of using the Facebook and Instagram apps as sources of page views.</p><p>While it is up for debate whether Facebook would go so far as to remove its core ads altogether, a thriving internet business could allow it to impose a stricter filter on the kinds of ads it shows or avoid having to show more per organic News Feed post than it does already.</p><p>That could help place more focus on video advertising, a play that Facebook has pursued for some time, while fewer ad spots would make those actually on the social network considerably more valuable. Scarcity would mean these spots are more valuable to advertisers and, potentially, more relevant and less intrusive.</p><p>Facebook’s big competitor in the global ads market is Google. The search giant might arguably know more about people’s browsing habits. But since Google failed at social, it never got users voluntarily filling out profiles full of valuable, targetable personal information.</p><p>One thing is for sure from today’s news though: if you’ve avoided getting a Facebook account so far or have quit the social network, there is no hiding — Facebook will find you on the internet.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Around the world, wireless carriers are building all-new cellular networks for the Internet of Things. These new networks won’t work with cell phones —  they’re made for IoT devices that don’t yet exist. These aren’t small players, either. Comcast, SoftBank, Orange, SKT, KPN, Swisscom and many others are building all-new nationwide IoT networks. Verizon and Vodafone are upgrading their networks, setting aside spectrum just for IoT. Cisco, Samsung, Nokia and Ericsson are selling equipment to make it work.</p><p>New networks are necessary because cell phone networks fall short for IoT in three ways: battery life, cost and wireless coverage.</p><p>Solving just one of those factors would be enough to justify new networks. Solving all three is a game-changer for IoT — and that’s what these new networks plan to do.</p><p>Let’s take those three reasons in turn.</p><p>Cellular phone networks are not power-efficient. And they never will be.</p><p>Mobile phone networks were originally designed for car phones. Coordinating a “hand-off” from one cell tower to another at 65 MPH —  all without interrupting a phone call —  was the technological breakthrough that made cellular networks possible. Those hand-offs require sophisticated algorithms and continuous communication between phone and network.</p><p>Because of that legacy, devices on cell phone networks must communicate multiple times per second with the cell tower. That’s very expensive for battery life.</p><p>To get years of battery life, IoT devices need to spend most of their time in “sleep” mode, not using the radio. Cellular phone networks don’t allow that. While you might think you can just turn the device off and turn it back on, reconnecting to cell phone networks can take several battery-draining minutes. If you’ve waited impatiently for your phone to re-connect after a flight, you know what I’m talking about.</p><p>The new cell networks for IoT take a different approach.</p><p>First, they use low-power radio chips, optimized to minimize the power cost of data transmission and reception. The power draw on these systems is typically an order of magnitude lower than cellular radios.</p><p>Second, they allow devices to sleep for minutes or hours without contacting the network. Devices spend 99.9 percent of their time in low-power mode, waking for just milliseconds to send or receive data, to read a sensor or activate a control.</p><p>That increases battery life by several orders of magnitude.</p><p>Achieving years of battery life is a really big deal for IoT because it effectively eliminates installation costs  —  no wires to run, no batteries to charge. IoT can become truly set-and-forget, which matters a lot when you’re placing thousands or millions of devices.</p><p>That’s a big deal — and reason enough to build new networks.</p><p>First, supporting IoT devices is costly to cellular carriers. Wireless spectrum costs billions, and carriers never have enough of it. IoT devices that pay less than a dollar per month will never get network access priority over cell phones with $100 voice and data plans. The opportunity cost of supporting IoT devices is too high.</p><p>To solve that problem, the new IoT networks are built either on unlicensed bands, or in the relatively unused “guard bands” between channels of licensed cellular spectrum. Either way, the spectrum is effectively free.</p><p>But using cell phone networks is also expensive for developers of devices. LTE radios are complex, require multiple antennas and require expensive IP licenses. They cost tens of dollars. Chipsets for the new IoT networks are a buck or two at scale.</p><p>Finally, network certification is expensive. For example, it costs $50,000-100,000 to certify a device on Verizon’s network, and the process takes months. Certification is necessary because flawed devices might interfere with phones on Verizon’s network. They are justifiably careful.</p><p>New IoT networks are designed to be robust to interference, because they’re designed to operate in shared bands where interference is the norm. And in many cases, an end-user can set up their own gateway, just like a Wi-Fi access point, at no cost.</p><p>Which brings us to the next point.</p><p>The truth is, LTE isn’t everywhere. And IoT devices have a nasty tendency to be deployed in precisely the places that today’s cell networks don’t reach: like flood detectors in basements, parking sensors in underground lots and soil sensors in rural corn fields.</p><p>New IoT networks handle coverage concerns in two different ways.</p><p>First, the networks are optimized to maximize deep indoor penetration, rather than bandwidth. A basic rule of RF modulation is that you can trade range for bandwidth by transmitting a lot of bits to represent a single bit. While LTE is optimized for data-hungry smartphones, new IoT networks are optimized for short messages —  say, a sensor reading or a command to set a thermostat. They’ll get far more range at the same power levels, albeit at bit rates often less than 1 Kbps.</p><p>Second, in some cases, gateways can be self-deployed, plunked down like Wi-Fi routers. So if your local carrier doesn’t reach your basement, you can drop your own gateway nearby to bring it online. Self-deployed networks will be critical to the rollout of these technologies, especially in the early days as carrier-operated networks are still rolling out.</p><p>This is how IoT actually happens. Long battery life, low cost and ubiquitous coverage — all in one package.</p><p>I’ve spent years working on connected devices, and to me that sounds like the holy grail. It means set-and-forget devices that work everywhere.</p>",

    "content": "<p>If you believe in the mantra “innovate or die,” you might conclude that the largest consumer and retail brands are terminally ill. Giants like Kraft and Clorox all seem to be too slow and enslaved to shareholders to innovate. At the same time, they may be too large to perish…  at least for now.</p><p>What we have here is the perfect storm for a consumer mergers and acquisitions (M&A) avalanche.</p><p>Big consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies are struggling to sell their products to a new generation of shoppers. A quick look at sales across various product sectors shows a steady downward slide for big brands. In the past five years, large brands lost market share to small brands in 42 of the top 54 most relevant food categories, according to Jefferies. Erosion is happening in nearly every consumer category.</p><p>As consumers increasingly crave unique, authentic brands that meet personal preferences, marketing and distribution costs are falling dramatically. Consumers are researching and seeking out products rather than responding to advertising.</p><p>Major CPG companies are losing billions in market share. And they aren’t doing much about it. When was the last time a large consumer brand introduced an innovative product that anybody noticed? Research and development (R&D) should be more important — but is less emphasized — than ever.</p><p>At CircleUp, we recently pulled some data illustrating just how bad the R&D problem has become. We found that, on average, the biggest consumer packaged goods companies spend less than 2 percent of revenue on R&D, and close to 15 percent on marketing and advertising. In technology, where innovation is front and center, the spending is nearly reversed: about 13 percent on R&D and 2 percent on marketing and advertising.</p><p>Big brands aren’t oblivious to the challenges they’re facing. So why aren’t they investing more in new product development?</p><p>For decades, large brands have been protected by the high cost of entry into the CPG market. The pre-social media, pre-Amazon era made it extremely expensive for small companies to get distribution and advertise their products. Demand for innovation was extremely low because consumers were so accustomed to seeing the same products on the shelf.</p><p>The path to innovation — developing and testing new products and weighing market responses — is flat-out risky. It could lead to quarterly and yearly losses and the future revenue takes years to kick in (if it does at all). Brand managers responsible for R&D decisions often have short-term incentives to not take risks. Should we meet our quarterly numbers or should we innovate on a new product that likely won’t show top-line impact until years after I’m transferred to run another division?</p><p>Big brands don’t have the personnel to change</p><p>There have been so few incentives to change for so many years that most big brands don’t have robust R&D teams or experience. These behemoths just aren’t well-equipped to test the water and make great new products.</p><p>These companies are decades old, sometimes a century, and they aren’t used to change. The image of your grandfather on the dance floor comes to mind. As does Clay Christensen’s “The Innovator’s Dilemma,” which calls out this trend. Big brands spend so much effort selling their existing products that they fail to plan for the future, then struggle shifting to solve for a problem they weren’t born into.</p><p>Mergers and acquisitions are, effectively, big consumer brands’ substitute for R&D. And with drastically shrinking market share, slow growth and big cash war chests on their balance sheets, we’ll be sure to see a lot more of it. And a lot more early-stage investing, as well, so they can participate in more of the growth, earlier in a brand’s life.</p><p>Unilever spent a mere 1.9 percent on its R&D last year, but it hasn’t been shy about hedging bets elsewhere, snatching up Dollar Shave Club ($1 billion) and Seventh Generation ($700 million). Unable to outflank startup brands, big consumer brands are upping their M&A games as a way to outsource R&D and leave the risk of innovation to the startups that do it best.</p><p>This trend has already taken hold in the pharmaceutical industry. The conglomerates there skip R&D almost entirely, acquire new formulas like crazy, then plug those products into their vast distribution pipes while they focus on advertising and regulatory issues. Big consumer brands are on the same path.</p><p>But the deciding factor, and what we’ve yet to see, is how well these big brands preserve the quality and authenticity of their newly acquired products. People increasingly demand personalized offerings, be it organic, environmentally sustainable, fair-trade, of an ethnic variety — the list goes on. Now, the seemingly simple act of selecting a household cleaning solution is an act of self-expression. If big brands don’t preserve the uniqueness, they’ll be back where they started.</p><p>The forces behind an M&A avalanche have been building for several years. Last year alone the M&A in consumer and retail was $238 billion, almost twice the size of M&A in tech. The M&A avalanche signals are there, and they’re only growing stronger. Get ready for the ride.</p>",

    "content": "<p>People aren’t using Facebook less, according to its new earnings report. Facebook recovered from last quarter’s miss, beating the street’s estimates in Q2 2015 with $4.04 billion in revenue and $0.50 earnings per share. Facebook now has 1.49 billion monthly users, up 3.47 percent quarter over quarter, which was a bit slower than Q1’s 3.6 percent growth.</p><p>Analysts had predicted $3.99 billion in revenue with 47 cents EPS. However, GAAP net income year-over-year, the measure of Facebook’s real profit, is down from $791 million to $719 million. That seems to be contributing to the current 1.39 percent dip in Facebook’s share price to $95.53 in after-hours trading.</p><p>But in terms of the long-term health of the social network, the most important stat is that Facebook held strong at 65 percent stickiness, or DAU divided by MAU. That’s the representation of how engaged users are, and the fact that it’s not slipping is a good sign as the service competes for attention with Snapchat and Twitter.</p><p>Mobile now makes up a huge 76 percent of advertising revenue, up from 73 percent last quarter. Mobile monthly users grew 4.8 percent  to 1.31 billion from 1.25 billion, and mobile daily users grew 5.76 percent to 844 million from 798 million, both a little slower than last quarter. Daily active users hit 968 million, up 3.41 percent from 936 million.</p><p>For comparison, Twitter’s user count grew just 2.6 percent this quarter, or just 0.66 percent if you don’t count “SMS Fast Follow” users that don’t see ads.</p><p>The most interesting stat from Facebook’s earnings call was when CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that Facebook Events has hit “global scale” with 450 million users. That means it could be ready to get its own standalone app focused on helping people answer the question “What should I do tonight?”</p><p>Another important point discussed was Facebook’s playbook for monetizing Messenger and WhatsApp. Like how Facebook delayed ads in the News Feed in favor of first allowing voluntary interactions with business Pages, Facebook wants people to connect organically to businesses over chat before it lets companies pay to reach customers.</p><p>Zuckerberg also ran through the stats for Facebook’s family of apps, including 800 million WhatsApp users, 700 million Messenger users, 300 million Instagram users, 850 million Groups users, and 40 million small businesses using Pages.</p><p>Facebook spent the quarter aggressively improving its advertising and e-commerce options while trying to pull content inside its walled garden, including videos and Instant Articles.</p><p>It’s added buy buttons and auto-filled email sign-up forms to News Feed. With well over 4 billion video views per day, it’s begun selling video ads with guaranteed 10-second views, compared to the option to just buy three-second video impressions.</p><p>Meanwhile, Messenger has grown into a behemoth chat app, now hosting 700 million users. The recent rollout of friend-to-friend payments and an app platform could help Facebook deepen loyalty among its users, while relying on its core app’s News Feed ads to earn money.</p><p>Improved Instagram ad targeting and formats mean it could start producing big revenue from its photo sharing app. Facebook still isn’t saying much about Instagram or WhatsApp in its earnings report. Unofficially, eMarketer estimates Instagram will hit $595 million in revenue this year.</p><p>Facebook seems to have solved the ad revenue issue in its “rest of world” region, which includes many developing nations in South America and Africa. The ability to monetize users with slower network connections and older phones is critical to Facebook’s long-term revenue growth, since it’s already saturated user penetration in its key Western markets.</p><p>The recent launch of the stripped-down Facebook Lite Android app could make surfing the social network and seeing its ads even easier for people around the planet.</p><p>Facebook is only just beginning to see the fruits of its quest to absorb the Internet. In 18 months, it’s gone from hardly showing any videos to becoming a massive host of viewership. Organic clips from users and businesses provide cover, masking the intrusion of auto-play video ads.</p><p>With Instant Articles, it’s found a way to turn a giant hole in its garden wall into a new way to earn money. Instead of users slipping out to read articles on news sites or closing the app in frustration as they load, Instant Articles keep users bouncing around inside Facebook’s app where they see ads.</p><p>If not for last quarter’s miss that it blamed on foreign exchange fluctuations, this would have been Facebook’s 12th straight beat. And while many were sure Snapchat’s rapid growth would take a big bite out of Facebook’s, the company has continued steady growth. 11 years in, and people still can’t get enough of Facebook.</p>",

The peaceful transition of power has been an enduring and vital part of our democracy for over two centuries, and it remains so today,” Microsoft chief legal officer Brad Smith wrote in a blog post.</p><p>Smith said that Trump’s victory was driven by economic disparity, noting that job growth has not grown evenly for those who have college degrees and those who do not. Trump’s supporters felt “left out and left behind,” he added, noting that Microsoft will work to create new jobs to address the gap.</p><p>However, Smith’s post also offers a quiet repudiation of Trump’s anti-immigration and anti-encryption stances.</p><p>“As we think societally about these new opportunities to address those who have been left behind, it’s critically important that we appreciate the continuing national strengths that serve the country so well,” Smith wrote, noting that diversity has a place in strengthening the economy and encouraging job growth. “We’re committed to promoting not just diversity among all the men and women who work here, but the type of inclusive culture that will enable people to do their best work and pursue rewarding careers.”</p><p>His comments on diversity were echoed at eBay, where CEO Devin Wenig issued a memo to employees reminding them of founder Pierre Omidyar’s immigrant background. “As I travel to our offices around the world, I have the privilege to interact with people of countless nationalities and backgrounds. This diversity is one of the most valuable assets we have as we drive our business forward,” Wenig wrote.</p><p>Smith also subtly went to bat for consumer privacy and access to encryption (Trump has called for tech companies, most notably Apple, to provide backdoor access to the government).</p><p>“People will not use technology they do not trust.

    "content": "<p>Facebook debuted chatbots for Messenger this week to much fanfare, promising consumers a new way to interact with their favorite businesses over the company’s popular messaging service. The idea is that Messenger users could simply “chat” with these automated software programs to do things like read the latest news from CNN, get a weather report or even go shopping. In practice, however, the bots — at least at launch — failed to live up to the hype.</p><p>Trying to use the bots for simple tasks — like finding out if it would rain or buying a black shirt — was frustrating, disappointing and ultimately far less efficient than simply visiting the company’s website itself.</p><p>That’s not to downplay the potential for bots in the long term, or the possibilities provided by bringing Facebook’s large base of businesses to Messenger where they could better serve customers who increasingly use mobile messaging apps while on their smartphones.</p><p>However, as the chatbots for Messenger platform launches, the bot experience leaves much to be desired.</p><p>To get a good feel for Facebook’s chatbots, we demoed the three “Featured” bots that Facebook is promoting via its Messenger platform website: CNN, shopping app Spring and weather app Poncho.</p><p>Each bot had a “Try it” link provided, which opens directly on Messenger a chat interface with the business.</p><p>For starters, clicking this link — the new short URLs aimed at Facebook Page owners (in the m.me format) — merely launched the chat window; there was no greeting text from the business in question. In other words, though you know that there’s a bot to interact with, you don’t know how to begin.</p><p>Does it require a trigger word or phrase? Can you just say “hi?”</p><p>Facebook will reportedly soon address this problem when it finalizes the rollout of “Messenger Greetings,” which will allow businesses to pass along a note to customers when they kick off a chat session. These greetings could instruct users how to get started using the bot. It’s unclear why Facebook wouldn’t have this enabled for the chatbots at launch, though. After all, this whole concept is new to so many of today’s mobile messaging users who are not old enough to remember chatting with IM bots like SmarterChild from back in their PC days.</p><p>As it turns out, not all the bots operate the same way.</p><p>For example, simply saying “hi” to CNN and Poncho generated an automated response, but Spring’s bot ignored me. (I had to Google to find out that the way to talk to Spring was to say “go shopping” to it.)</p><p>Unfortunately, that was the least of my problems with using the bots.</p><p>Here’s a simple problem a chatbot could help me solve, I thought: I’m in the market for a new shirt. I like the color black and I don’t want to spend a lot. Couldn’t Spring’s new shopping bot help point me to some nice items?</p><p>I didn’t expect it to succeed in helping me narrow top shirts by details like sleeve length or fabric type at this early point, but I at least believed it could pull up a few possibilities.</p><p>After getting the shopping session started by the keyword trigger, Spring’s bot interface is easy enough to use. It asks you a series of questions to narrow down what you’re looking for — Men’s or Women’s items?, “Clothing, Shoes, or Accessories?”, etc. — and you click on your response.</p><p>After I narrowed it down to tops under $75, Spring returned five items it thought I would like.</p><p>Why would I like these particular items? I don’t know. Spring knows nothing about my shopping history, what style of shirt I’m looking for, the color, the occasion (work or casual) or anything else.</p><p>It returned three white shirts, one t-shirt, and a sweater.</p><p>At this point, I’d like to ask the bot for more options. But how do you do that?</p><p>I tried “chatting” with the bot, assuming at this point, anything I said would at least trigger a new “help” message that explains how to continue using the service.</p><p>“I don’t like these” I told it, and was met with silence.</p><p>“hi?” I spoke into the void. Nothing happened.</p><p>Finally, the bot answered, informing me that I could return to the options above and click them again to start the process over. Hopeful that the five items it returned were a randomized group and I’d see five new shirts if I repeated things, I did just that.</p><p>The bot returned the same five shirts.</p><p>Well, maybe I need to be more specific, I thought.</p><p>The bot gave me a link to its website.</p><p>I know what you’re thinking. Well maybe Spring didn’t have any black shirts under $75? But it did! The link pointed to Women’s black shirts on the Spring site, and there are more than a few from which to choose.</p><p>The thing is, it just would have been easier to visit Spring’s website directly, rather than dancing through this chatty interface.</p><p>Poncho’s snarky weather bot was even worse. Though I got it talking with a simple “hi,” its weather reports failed to deliver even the most basic information, like when it would rain.</p><p>After getting my location and asking if it could message me daily weather reports (NOPE!, I said), it told me I could still chat with it for other information, specifically:</p><p>“Feel free to ask me if it’s going to rain, if you need sunglasses or a jacket, or just say hello from time to time!”</p><p>So I asked: “is it going to rain?”</p><p>Is that supposed to be a real answer?</p><p>I tried to get Poncho to clarify — did “wet” mean rain was coming, then?</p><p>“Sorry, you’re going to have to say that again in Cat.

    "content": "<p>Facebook built two versions of a fix for clickbait this year, and decided to trust algorithmic machine learning detection instead of only user behavior, a Facebook spokesperson tells TechCrunch.</p><p>Today Facebook was hit with more allegations its distribution of fake news helped elect Donald Trump. A new Gizmodo report saying Facebook shelved a planned update earlier this year that could have identified fake news because it would disproportionately demote right-wing news outlets.</p><p>Facebook directly denies this, telling TechCrunch “The article’s allegation is not true. We did not build and withhold any News Feed changes based on their potential impact on any one political party.”</p><p>However, TechCrunch has pulled more details from Facebook about the update Gizmodo discusses.</p><p>Back in January 2015, Facebook rolled out an update designed to combat hoax news stories, which demoted links that were heavily flagged as fake by users, and that were often deleted later by users who posted them. That system is still in place.</p><p>In August 2016, Facebook released another News Feed update designed to reduce clickbait stories. Facebook trained a machine learning algorithm by having humans identify common phrases in old news headlines of clickbait stories. The machine learning system then would identify and demote future stories that featured those clickbait phrases.</p><p>According to Facebook, it developed two different options for how the 2016 clickbait update would work. One was a classifier based off the 2015 hoax detector based on user reports, and another was the machine learning classifier built specifically for detecting clickbait via computer algorithm.</p><p>Facebook says it found the specially-made machine learning clickbait detector performed better with fewer false positives and false negatives, so that’s what Facebook released. It’s possible that that the unreleased version is what Gizmodo is referring to as the shelved update. Facebook tells me that unbalanced clickbait demotion of right-wing stories wasn’t why it wasn’t released, but political leaning could still be a concern.</p><p>The choice to rely on a machine learning algorithm rather than centering the fix around user reports aligns with Facebook’s recent push to reduce the potential for human bias in its curation, which itself has been problematic.</p><p>A Gizmodo report earlier this year alleged that Facebook’s human Trend curators used their editorial freedom to suppress conservative trends. Facebook denied the allegations but fired its curation team, moving to a more algorithmic system without human-written Trend descriptions. Facebook was then criticized for fake stories becoming trends, and the New York Times reports “The Trending Topics episode paralyzed Facebook’s willingness to make any serious changes to its products that might compromise the perception of its objectivity.”</p><p>If Facebook had rolled out the unreleased version of its clickbait fix, it might have relied on the subjective opinions of staffers reviewing user reports about hard-to-classify clickbait stories the way it does with more cut-and-dry hoaxes. Meanwhile, political activists or trolls could have abused the reporting feature, mass-flagging accurate stories as false if they conflicted with their views.</p><p>This tricky situation is the inevitable result of engagement-ranked social feeds becoming massively popular distribution channels for news in a politically-polarized climate where campaign objectives and ad revenue incentivize misinformation.</p><p>Facebook as well as other news distributors such as Twitter and Google have a challenge ahead. Clear hoaxes that can be disproven with facts are only part of the problem, and perhaps are easier to address. Exaggerated and heavily-spun stories that might be considered clickbait may prove tougher to fight.</p><p>Because Facebook and some other platforms reward engagement, news outlets are incentivized to frame stories as sensationally as possible. While long-running partisan outlets may be held accountable for exaggeration, newer outlets built specifically to take advantage of virality on networks like Facebook don’t face the same repercussions. They can focus on short-term traffic and ad revenue, and if people get fed up with their content, they can simply reboot with a different brand.</p><p>Simplifying user flagging of fake or exaggerated stories, appending fact-checking sites to suspicious articles, and withholding distribution from domains that haven’t proven their accuracy but prioritize monetization could be some ways to fight the avalanche of fake news. More clearly needs to be done.</p><p>But perhaps its risky to demand networks like Facebook become the truth police. That could force it to make more wide-reaching calls about what to censor that would inevitably invite blame. At least technology platforms that err on the side of ranking by engagement allow users to decide individually if what they read is false or exaggerated. Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reiterated this perspective, writing “I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.”</p><p>Right now, Facebook is damned if does allow fake news to spread because it relies on users to think for themselves, but it’s damned if it doesn’t allow fake news to spread because it makes decisions about what to censor that remove the power of choice from its users. The social network will have to choose its next moves carefully.</p>",

    "content": "<p>PlayOn has long offered media server software that allows cord cutters to record from streaming services like Netflix, Amazon, HBO, Hulu and others, in order to watch on any device – without ads – even when offline. Now, it’s taking this “cloud DVR” functionality to mobile through the launch of a new iOS application that lets you record and watch videos offline via your smartphone.</p><p>With PlayOn Cloud, launched this week, iOS users can initiate and download recordings to their mobile device. The app will then keep a copy of the recording in the cloud for 30 days, so you can watch the video whenever you choose. The app also offers AdSkip technology, which lets you skip through video ads.</p><p>I know what you’re probably thinking: wait, this is legal? Well, uh…that’s tricky. The streaming service providers’ terms of service explicitly prohibit this behavior. For example, Netflix says that by using its service, you agree not to archive, download, reproduce, or distribute its videos. Hulu makes it clear that you should not use “any device, software, internet site, web-based service or other means” to do the same.</p><p>The others follow suit, with similar language.</p><p>That being said, recording the streams is technically possible, and copyright law has left some wiggle room for services like PlayOn to exist.</p><p>The way the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) puts it, breaking or circumventing copy protection mechanisms is what’s illegal. And PlayOn hasn’t been circumventing DRM or accessing the encrypted stream – it uses screen capturing technology instead. This keeps it on the legal side by following the letter of the law, if not the spirit.</p><p>But let’s be clear, this is a very much a gray, murky area, so buyer beware.</p><p>The mobile app explains that when you’re recording from mobile, what’s really happening is that you’re commanding a virtual server to start a web browser session to play and record the content you’ve selected.</p><p>In practice, what this means in terms of functionality is that recordings take place in real time, as they do on the desktop version of PlayOn. So if you want to save a movie for later viewing, you’ll need to account for two hours or so of recording time, plus the extra time it takes to later download to your device for offline viewing. In other words, it’s not something you can use at the last minute before your flight, for example – you’ll need to plan in advance.</p><p>Also, to be clear, PlayOn can’t grab you an HBO show if you don’t subscribe. In order for you to record any videos, you have to first sign into the various services.</p><p>The company generates revenue by selling “credits” which you use to buy a recording. A credit costs 99 cents, but a launch deal is offering 25 credits for $17.50, using the code “cheapsake.” You can purchase at this rate up to 100 credits. There’s also another deal that’s offering five free credits to anyone who downloads the app before Sunday, Nov. 13.</p><p>At launch, PlayOn Cloud on iOS supports recordings from Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, Yahoo! View, HBO NOW, YouTube, NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, PBS and The CW.</p><p>The app itself was a little frustrating to use. After signing up, it got stuck on a loading screen for so long, there seemed to be something wrong. I had to force close the app to get it to work. The navigational buttons at the bottom of the screen are also very small, as are the other screen elements and fonts. Plus, the overall user interface feels very utilitarian.</p><p>But people aren’t using PlayOn for its looks, they’re using it for what it does.</p><p>Still, I ran into a few glitches. Some buttons didn’t work the first time I pressed them. And when I tried to record a show after buying a credit, I got an error message. However, when I checked the recording status in the queue – the screen that shows you the progress by the minute – the show was recording.</p><p>PlayOn operates in something of an odd space in the streaming landscape. Right now, it’s filling consumers’ need for a service that offers them offline viewing. But offline access to video is already available for some shows on Amazon, and even Netflix has said it would consider the technology in the future. Meanwhile, the world is becoming more blanketed in Wi-Fi – even on planes – which diminishes the need for an app like this.</p><p>The other advantage is that you could save a video to your device before it leaves the streaming service.</p><p>PlayOn is available as a free download on iOS. An Android version is in the works.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Religion and technology are not two phrases that often go hand in hand. Molly Burhans is looking to change that. Growing up Catholic in upstate New York, Burhans had the intention of becoming a nun. However, after studying landscape and ecological design in graduate school, she discovered a different calling.</p><p>In her coursework, Burhans begin using geographic or geospatial information systems, GIS, to better plan wetland restoration on individual parcels of nearby land. GIS is a general term for a tool that allows users to store, analyze and visualize layers of information over a map. Today the technology is used in a variety of ways — to predict earthquakes and the presence of oil reserves, model the impacts of global warming and monitor the global spread of disease.</p><p>Burhans began researching the land holdings of the Catholic Church and was surprised to find that none existed. It is said that the individual dioceses, various Catholic religious orders and the Vatican in aggregate comprise of the world’s largest land holders. Exactly how much land appears to be unclear. Like so many industries, the Church has struggled to modernize its data set. According to Burhans, much of the information is dispersed, contained within .PDFs in dioceses or local parishes. Opportunities for better land planning around the Church’s holdings were nonexistent.</p><p>Burhans founded GoodLands to use mapping technologies to do just that. Ultimately, she hopes that the data can be used to “create a greater sense of stewardship” in communities and promote positive change in planning for environmental and social change.</p><p>To date, GoodLands has mapped 35,000 Church properties in the U. S. as part of their Catholic Geographic Information Systems Center (CGISC). To gather the raw data, GoodLands partnered with parishioners, academic institutions, NGOs and other social services.</p><p>Today, GoodLands is announcing a partnership with ESRI, the global leader in GIS. With ESRI’s technology, GoodLands will be able to visualize and analyze the data to present a global landscape of holdings overlaid with the structure and population distribution of the one billion-plus Catholics globally.</p><p>Burhans recently traveled to Rome to participate in the Vatican Youth Symposium. CGISC has been approved by the Vatican’s Technology and Arts Council, hopefully indicating an openness from the top to collaborate and act on the findings of GoodLands’ research.</p><p>A more compelling early use case that GoodLands has mapped has to do with climate change. Using climate models available through ESRI, CGISC can identify parishes significantly impacted by global warming and visualize a map of growing-season reduction. This could allow parishes to better serve the needs of their communities by planning more focused outreach, education and service efforts.</p><p>In a related example, using weather prediction models, GoodLands can show the Church which dioceses are likely to need aid or assistance in the coming years based off likelihood of hurricanes and other destructive natural disasters.</p><p>Today, nonprofit GoodLands’ vision is much broader. The company aims to have a hybrid structure, part nonprofit, part for-profit, that sells various mapping models. The company also has future plans to assist parishes in their own land planning efforts.</p><p>Burhans is honest when she says that the true geo/religious impact of GoodLands’ work is unclear. Still, it’s interesting to see one of the oldest institutions on earth collide with technology.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The current generation of chatbots is, at best, disappointing. Kitt.ai, which is launching its private beta today, hopes to change that. The team of three AI PhDs that founded the company believes that its ChatFlow framework will make it easier for developers to build useful chatbots that can work on multiple platforms and easily hold multi-turn conversations.</p><p>Seattle-based Kitt.ai started with a focus on Amazon’s Alexa platform (and received funding from the Alexa Fund) and participated in Paul Allen’s AI2 incubator program.</p><p>Before turning its attention to ChatFlow, though, the team worked on a smaller project for hotword detection (think “OK, Google” or “Alexa”). In some way, that’s no surprise, given that co-founder Guoguo Chen worked on some of the fundamental technology behind “OK, Google” while he was interning at the company.</p><p>With ChatFlow, though, Kitt.ai isn’t just launching a basic chatbot platform. It’s combining a slick point-and-click chatbot builder with its homegrown natural language understanding engine (which Kitt.ai co-founder Xuchen Yao believes is on par with Microsoft’s luis.ai and Nuance’s nlu.mix). Its secret weapon, though, is its focus on multi-turn dialogs.</p><p>The team argues that while services like Wit.ai did an excellent job at democratizing natural language understanding (NLU), that technology is now table stakes. “NLU is now a commodity — it’s an infrastructure service,” Yao, who co-founded the company with Chen and Kenji Sagae, told me. “But nobody is doing dialog right.” He believes that Kitt.ai’s competitors are mostly layering dialog support on top of existing NLU projects. “But to do dialog right, you need a completely new approach,” he said.” The traditional way of programming dialog is to draw a dialog on a whiteboard and input that.” Kitt.ai’s interface cuts out that step and allows developers to draw the diagram as they are implementing the code.</p><p>Developers will be able to integrate their bots with virtually any existing API. The team already set up sample applications that show off integrations with the likes of Uber, Lyft and Yelp.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Kitt.ai only provides you with the tools to write a chatbot — it doesn’t program one for you. “But we understand how difficult it is to program a good chatbot,” Yao said. “Or — in other words — how easy it is to screw up and write a bad one.” Looking ahead then, the team also wants to make it easier for developers to test their chatbots. While Yao didn’t want to go into the details of Kitt.ai’s plans, he did say the company’s roadmap includes a framework for making testing chatbots and their responses easier (or maybe even automatic).</p><p>ChatFlow currently supports Alexa, Facebook Messenger, Kik, Skype, Slack, Telegram and Twilio. If you want to give it a try, you can sign up for the beta here. Yao said the service will likely remain in private beta for a while. After that, the team plans to follow Atlassian’s freemium model with free or cheap access for individual developers and small teams, and higher charges for enterprise customers.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Xiaomi is broadening its already expansive range of products by venturing into virtual reality for the first time.</p><p>The company today announced the Mi VR Play, an “entry-level” virtual reality headset that it hopes can open this new exciting medium to new audiences because not everyone has thousands of dollars needed to set up an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Democratizing technology is the thesis behind most of Xiaomi’s competitively priced products, including the $550/$750 notebook announced last week that will rival Apple’s Macbook in China.</p><p>This new device recalls Google’s super-cheap and super-simple Cardboard VR headset. It is fairly basic in nature; you pop a smartphone into the lycra-built body then open Xiaomi’s Mi VR app, which contains VR content from selected partners that include Conde Nast Traveler and YouKu, “China’s YouTube.” Xiaomi pledged to invest $1 billion in video content, including VR, last year, so that library is sure to get bigger over time.</p><p>Mi VR Play has significantly improved upon the design typically used in similar VR products — it is wrapped in lightweight, durable Lycra for long-lasting comfort. In the future, Mi VR Play will also be available in a selection of bold prints and colours for even more stylish options. The unique two-way zipper helps to ensure compatibility, providing a secure grip on a wide range of 4.7- to 5.7-inch smartphones. At the same time, the dual openings on the front allow for slight positioning adjustments and ventilation.</p><p>Here’s the catch — you can’t go and buy one, even if you’re in China.</p><p>Xiaomi is making it available to a limited number of beta test users, who signed up on August 1 when Xiaomi put out a call for volunteers. One million users signed up in just eight hours, the company said, but Xiaomi has selected just a fraction of those — likely “tens of thousands,” a representative told TechCrunch.</p><p>For those lucky ones accepted into the test program, the Mi VR Play will cost just RMB 1 ($0.15).</p><p>Xiaomi told us that it has plans to make the headset more widely available in the future, but there’s no schedule for that right now. Along those lines, it isn’t clear how much the headset will cost once it is on sale to all. We suspect it won’t be RMB 1, sadly.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Facebook Messenger’s quest to own all the ways you connect with friends is now expanding to games. Today I spotted “Doodle Draw Game” in the Messenger platform app list, and Facebook says this is the first true game available since the platform launched in April.</p><p>Initially, Facebook only allowed content creation apps like GIF and sound effect makers on the Messenger Platform. The closest thing to a game was Talking Tom, which lets you choose a cartoon avatar to deliver your video message.</p><p>But before the platform’s launch, sources told me Facebook was interested in eventually expanding it to a broader set of experiences, including utilities and games if test data looked good. Last month The Information reported Facebook was actively considering how games would fit in Messenger.</p><p>Facebook tells me “Currently, we think Messenger Platform is best suited for apps that focus on content creation and curated content. But one of the reasons we were excited to announce at F8 that Messenger Platform is open to all developers is to see what people build. From there, we’ll think about what else might make sense.”</p><p>Doodle Draw for iOS and Android will be familiar to anyone who played Draw Something…because it’s a blatant copy of the 2012 flash in the pan mobile game that got acquired by Zynga for an exorbitant price. Don’t feel too bad for the fallen games giant, though, as Draw Something was just a mobile version of the classic party game Pictionary. You can download app developer Clay‘s Doodle Draw here, by tapping the “•••” button in a Messenger chat thread to open the platform app list.</p><p>Doodle Draw suggests a few things for you to draw, which you then scribble out with a limited set of colors and send to a friend. They have to guess what you drew. Players can earn points by playing to buy more colors, but you can easily imagine the ability to buy this in-game currency for real money down the line.</p><p>It’s unclear whether Facebook would one day earn a cut of such revenue, but for now it’s not taxing other Messenger apps like Ultratext that sells premium filters.</p><p>Years ago, Facebook’s 30 percent tax on games on its desktop canvas game platform earned it some significant dollars. Game payments have significantly shrunk as a share of Facebook’s revenue, though. On mobile, Facebook Messenger’s focus seems to be driving engagement and platform lock-in with the social network while the main Facebook app’s ads are the bread-winner.</p><p>Done right, Messenger could foster an ecosystem of social games that rely on private messaging and keep users coming back to its chat app. These games would ideally benefit from being part of a chat thread and fit in naturally. In Doodle Draw, you could message and laugh about each other’s mangled depictions.</p><p>But done wrong, these games could spawn Messenger spam the same way Facebook desktop games polluted the News Feed. Companies like Zynga developed exploitative game mechanics where you earned in-game rewards for inviting friends and pestering them to play with requests and News Feed posts. It got so bad that Facebook almost entirely shut off these viral channels to avoid ruining the feed for everyone, and social game companies were hit hard by their diminished ability to recruit new users.</p><p>Doodle Draw is already leaning in a spammy direction, which is worrying. You earn in-game currency for getting people to play with you, which could incentivize sending tons of crappy doodles to slews of friends. [Update: You can’t earn currency through invites anymore. More on that below.]</p><p>Facebook might be wise to take a firm stance against incentivized invites or communication to prevent partners from building businesses on the model that they later have to change. At least apps can’t send messages on your behalf and there’s no “Send To All” button.</p><p>Instead, the value exchange should be that developers build non-spammy games on Messenger that grow its engagement, and in return, if merited by their quality, the games gain exposure and growth. Messenger has risen to over 600 million users and over 1 billion downloads on Android by eschewing the clutter and annoyances of Facebook’s main app.</p><p>To paraphrase The Social Network, Facebook doesn’t quite know what Messenger could be but it knows that, though not quite “cool,” people don’t hate it. That is a priceless asset it shouldn’t squander through game spam.</p><p>[Update 3:15pm PST 6/10: In response to this article, Doodle Draw’s developer voluntarily removed the ability to earn in-game currency by inviting friends to play. So that’s a win for anti-spam. Hopefully Facebook will formally prohibit this in the future.]</p>",

Under the new policy, publishers will have to obtain EU end users’ consent before storing or accessing their data, says Google.</p><p>The change, which is in direct response to the EU’s cookie compliance regulations, follows the arrival of the Google-published website called CookieChoices, spotted earlier this month. That site was launched with the intention of helping digital publishers obtain tools and access other resources that will aid in their obligations to obtain user consent, Google noted at the time.</p><p>These tools include code that website publishers can use to inform visitors about their cookies, as well as those that can be used to directly obtain consent, like splash screens, notification bars, or one-time, pop-up alerts that can be used on mobile apps.</p><p>Says Jason Woloz, Google’s Security & Privacy Program Manager, Display and Video Ads, in a brief announcement posted today, “it has always been Google’s policy to comply with privacy laws, so we’ve agreed to make certain changes affecting our own products and partners using Google products.”</p><p>EU regulators have pushed for years for a variety of user protections when it comes to how web users’ data and information is tracked and made available online. One of its more-discussed rulings in recent months is related to the so-called “Right to be forgotten,” which legally requires that search engines like Google process individuals’ requests for the delisting of inaccurate, outdated and irrelevant data.</p><p>Meanwhile, the EU has had regulations related to cookie-related data collection for quite some time. But what’s notable is that Google is applying this to its own services, while also challenging publishers to comply with the updated policy by a September 30th, 2015 deadline, according to an email sent out about the change. In addition, this policy will also affect those with iOS or Android applications who will have to show a message to app users upon first launch.</p><p>While before, the EU’s cookie policy has been common for those sites based in the EU, Google’s policy change will affect a number of publishers, as any site on the web could potentially have EU-based traffic.</p><p>The effectiveness of cookie-related user consent notifications is questionable, however. According to a late 2014 study on the matter, the EU’s cookie-notification policy has cost billions of euros per year in terms of compliance costs for websites, but has offered few benefits to web users. That is to say, the implementations thus far have not changed user behavior, the report found.</p><p>Unfortunately, Google can’t offer a consent message that publishers can use, because a website or app’s consent message should say “will largely depend on your own uses of cookies and other information, and the third party services you work with,” says Google. But it does offer pointers on the Cookie Choices website to help publishers get started.</p><p>Google’s post also points to other resources beyond Cookie Choices, including a Help Center FAQ which details the answers to questions publishers may have, like which products are impacted, how to tell if a current policy is compliant, how the changes affect mobile websites, and more.</p><p>Here, Google also explains that the Article 29 Working Party, an umbrella body that comprises representatives of all EU data protection authorities, requested that changes were made to how site publishers request consent from end users. Google says it understands “these principles will be applied across the industry,” which is why it’s rolling out the change now.</p>",

    "content": "<p>If there’s one technology that promises to change the world more than any other over the next several decades, it’s (arguably) machine learning.</p><p>By enabling computers to learn certain things more efficiently than humans, and discover certain things that humans cannot, machine learning promises to bring increasing intelligence to software everywhere and enable computers to develop new capabilities –- from driving cars to diagnosing disease –- that were previously thought to be impossible.</p><p>While most of the core algorithms that drive machine learning have been around for decades, what has magnified its promise so dramatically in recent years is the extraordinary growth of the two fuels that power these algorithms – data and computing power.</p><p>Both continue to grow at exponential rates, suggesting that machine learning is at the beginning of a very long and productive run.</p><p>As revolutionary as machine learning will be, its impact will be highly asymmetric. While most machine learning algorithms, libraries and tools are in the public domain and computing power is a widely available commodity, data ownership is highly concentrated.</p><p>This means that machine learning will likely have a barbell effect on the technology landscape. On one hand, it will democratize basic intelligence through the commoditization and diffusion of services such as image recognition and translation into software broadly. On the other, it will concentrate higher-order intelligence in the hands of a relatively small number of incumbents that control the lion’s share of their industry’s data.</p><p>For startups seeking to take advantage of the machine learning revolution, this barbell effect is a helpful lens to look for the biggest business opportunities. While there will be many new kinds of startups that machine learning will enable, the most promising will likely cluster around the incumbent end of the barbell.</p><p>One of machine learning’s most lasting areas of impact will be to democratize basic intelligence through the commoditization of an increasingly sophisticated set of semantic and analytic services, most of which will be offered for free, enabling step-function changes in software capabilities. These services today include image recognition, translation and natural language processing and will ultimately include more advanced forms of interpretation and reasoning.</p><p>Software will become smarter, more anticipatory and more personalized, and we will increasingly be able to access it through whatever interface we prefer – chat, voice, mobile application, web, or others yet to be developed. Beneficiaries will include technology developers and users of all kinds.</p><p>This burst of new intelligent services will give rise to a boom in new startups that use them to create new products and services that weren’t previously cost effective or possible. Image recognition, for example, will enable new kinds of visual shopping applications. Facial recognition will enable new kinds of authentication and security applications. Analytic applications will grow ever more sophisticated in their ability to identify meaningful patterns and predict outcomes.</p><p>Startups that end up competing directly with this new set of intelligent services will be in a difficult spot. Competition in machine learning can be close to perfect, wiping out any potential margin, and it is unlikely many startups will be able to acquire data sets to match Google or other consumer platforms for the services they offer. Some of these startups may be bought for the asset values of their teams and technologies (which at the moment are quite high), but most will have to change tack in order to survive.</p><p>This end of the barbell effect is being accelerated by open source efforts such as OpenAI as well as by the decision of large consumer platforms, led by Google with TensorFlow, to open source their artificial intelligence software and offer machine learning-driven services for free, as a means of both selling additional products and acquiring additional data.</p><p>At the other end of the barbell, machine learning will have a deeply monopoly-inducing or monopoly-enhancing effect, enabling companies that have or have access to highly differentiated data sets to develop capabilities that are difficult or impossible for others to develop.</p><p>The primary beneficiaries at this end of the spectrum will be the same large consumer platforms offering free services such as Google, as well as other enterprises in concentrated industries that have highly differentiated data sets.</p><p>Large consumer platforms already use machine learning to take advantage of their immense proprietary data to power core competencies in ways that others cannot replicate – Google with search, Facebook with its newsfeed, Netflix with recommendations and Amazon with pricing.</p><p>Incumbents with large proprietary data sets in more traditional industries are beginning to follow suit.

Tesla announced upcoming changes to the Supercharger program today, which will introduce a fee for owners who purchase their vehicle after January 1, 2017 – but only if they exceed 400 kWh of charging in a year, which translates to roughly 1,000 miles of driving.</p><p>Once that threshold is passed, Tesla owners will begin being charged an incremental fee depending on usage, but one that will still undershoot the price of filling up a fuel-based car’s gas tank. As mentioned, orders until January 1, 2017 and existing owners and orders aren’t affected – they still get free Supercharging for the life of their vehicle, provided they take delivery before April 1, 2017.</p><p>Tesla says the change is about adjusting the economics of Supercharging in a way that “allows us to reinvest in the network, accelerate its growth,” but also notes that while they will begin charging customers after a certain point, the “Supercharger Network will never be a profit center,” which implies all funds generated will go to maintenance and expansion/improvement of the resource for drivers.</p><p>The timelines for the changes to come into effect mean that any Model 3 owners will have the capped Supercharging plan, and Tesla isn’t yet revealing the specifics of its usage-based pricing. That effective 1,000 mile cap means that the needs of many, many drivers will be met before they hit that Supercharge limit, however, since this really only impacts those using their cars for trips outside the car’s considerable range when they don’t have time or inclination to stop and charge at a normal rate.</p><p>Tesla also says it’ll release further details of how the pricing for charging beyond 400 kWh will work later this year, but also notes that these details may vary over time and by region, depending on the price of electricity and other factors.</p><p>We always new the unlimited free Supercharger program couldn’t last forever. At least legacy Tesla owners will at least be able to find some comfort over not getting hardware needed for self-driving in their cars with the knowledge that they can at least use Superchargers indefinitely.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Parents despairing of ever being able to separate their offspring from the mobile devices glued to their fingertips might be interested in an app called Play My Way that’s being built by a startup from Lebanon and designed to interrupt other apps with a little worthy educational content.</p><p>The team, currently based in London as part of a three-month accelerator program for Lebanese startups, reckons the answer to mobile addiction is not to ban or limit access to devices but rather to harness the stickiness of mobile technology as an opportunity for bite-size homework.</p><p>“The idea behind Play. My.Way is to make the best of the kid’s addiction,” says co-founder Salma Jawhar.</p><p>The learning takes the form of multiple choice questions in subjects such as math, science and English, with the app interrupting whatever else the device was being used for to push a question at the child. It’s basically push notification for homework.</p><p>Kids have to answer a question (and answer it correctly) if they want to get back to playing Candy Crush or watching YouTube or whatever else they were doing. The targeted age range is six- to fourteen-year-olds, with parents able to tailor questions to the appropriate grade level. The Play My Way app needs to be installed on kids’ devices to function.</p><p>The app does have a ‘help me’ button (which supplies the answer) and a ‘skip question’ option, so it’s not the hardest of taskmasters — although the number of helps is limited.</p><p>“Technically, our app does not interrupt. It just moves from background to foreground,” says Jawhar. “That way, if a child is playing (Minecraft for example) and Play. My.Way became the active app, all previous apps are immediately sent to run in the background.</p><p>“When interrupted, the child can ignore Play. My.Way, press the home button, and go back to their previous game. After 10 seconds, they will be interrupted again. This applies to any app, including the native phone functions. So suppose Play.My.Way is on the top, then, a phone call interrupts… after the phone call is done, Play.My.Way will remind the user that a question is waiting.”</p><p>The app does have a bit of a tell-tale character. “Parents are notified by email when their kid tries to close the app and a funny siren sound will play on the kid’s phone, along with a message asking them to go back to their question!” she adds.</p><p>The team has been working on the concept since April 2015, initially starting out crowdsourcing question content. They have amassed around 25,000 questions at this point and say they are negotiating with several suppliers to keep growing their educational content.</p><p>“We have an online portal for authors and reviewers where we crowd source teachers to create questions. Each question is reviewed twice by two different reviewers. We produce 4,000 new questions each month to be added to our database,” says Jawhar.</p><p>The beta version of the app launched in March 2016, and has around 23,000 users so far. It’s currently free but the intention for the team is to monetize the app via a $4.99 monthly subscription in future. The team started out bootstrapping but after launch were able to pull in $1 million from two angel investors for 10% of the company, according to Jawhar.</p><p>It’s possible the app might end up encouraging children to use their mobile devices less —  given they’ll be forced to do regular homework every time they play. But even if they remain as addicted to their phones and tablets as ever, the overarching aim is to have parents worry less by having at least some of their gadget playtime focused on targeted learning.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I spoke with Andrew Noonan, Partner Engineer at Uber. He shared the evolution of the company’s API, from its humble beginnings to a full-featured platform that lets developers build entirely new experiences for Uber riders. We also discussed a systematic approach to building an API platform that incentivizes developers.</p><p>How did the Uber API get started?</p><p>The platform started out with a simple API. You could get available products at a location and time and price estimates, but developers would need to deep link into our mobile app for ride requests.</p><p>Quickly, there was interest from developers to do more with Uber in their apps. As a result, we launched the ride request API.</p><p>That allowed developers to recreate more of the Uber experience, even without their users downloading our app. We’ve been making more and more investments along that path — making account creation through the developer platform a bit more seamless and really trying to expose all the utility of the Uber app via the API.</p><p>How do you approach the API as a platform?</p><p>We believe three pillars are necessary for any developer platform: utility, revenue and distribution.</p><p>Utility means using Uber to make your app better and more useful for your users. Because we’re a transactional service, we can expose all the utility of Uber without being afraid of developers recreating the Uber experience. As long as it holds up to the standards that our customers expect, any app can have an Uber mode.</p><p>Regarding revenue, it’s no secret — if you’re asking developers to write apps using your platform, they have to be able to pay the bills. We launched the API with the affiliate program, which gives developers $5 for every new rider they sign up. We have other ideas in the works. There has to be a real opportunity for them to make money.</p><p>If you’re asking developers to write apps using your platform, they have to be able to pay the bills.</p><p>Finally, if the developer building an app on your platform does have a business model, additional distribution is important. Trip experiences is our first big commitment into the second and third pillars of the developer platform.</p><p>It’s opening up access to a resource within Uber that we are not domain experts on and we’re not going to specifically capitalize on it ourselves. We’re not content producers; we’re not a deals website; we’re not a gaming company. We’d rather expose that via an API and let people build and iterate on top of it.</p><p>Tell me more about how you approached revenue from the beginning.</p><p>We look at the API as being a growth factor for the company in both established and emerging markets. The affiliate program was the right thing for us to do, both for Uber and for developers. We want to get new users on the platform and developers deserve the incentive.</p><p>We’ve seen it be successful for partners and it’s something we’ll continue to do, but we’re looking for more creative ways to provide revenue, too. Referring a rider is a great step, but we think that developers have the opportunity to drive real value for our riders. We will do what we can to promote that kind of innovation on our platform. Providing user growth opportunities can be a very powerful thing.</p><p>What are some examples of apps built on the Uber API?</p><p>We have some huge integrations like Baidu Maps in China. They have a full request to ride integration built on top of the API. Facebook Messenger is another big one. United Airlines is a great example of a top partner that was with us from the beginning and built on top of the early API and included deep linking into our apps.</p><p>In India, we had a partner launch that has been driving a significant amount of ride traffic called Helpchat. It’s basically a chat assistant that can order an Uber. We’re seeing this style of integration more and more.</p><p>Also, I’ve seen a couple of integrations at hackathons to order a ride via an SMS or over the phone. These apps help people who don’t have a smartphone but want to be able to call and get an Uber. They can set up all the authentication on the desktop and get a static phone number to call with a pin code. They can say where they are and an Uber will be sent to them.</p><p>How have you grown your developer community?</p><p>To help address this, we encourage engineers on the Developer Platform team to be part-time developer advocates. It’s a self-selecting group because the engineers interested in building the external API are engineers interested in going to hackathons and connecting with developers. We’ve been to hackathons and around the world to get people interested and make sure that we hear from them.</p><p>How have you scaled the API?</p><p>Having partners like Baidu forces us to think on a massive scale. We’ve been at a very steady pace of onboarding new developers and all kinds of integrations. There are tens of thousands of apps on the platform and it’s growing rapidly every day. It’s accelerating more than we’ve ever seen.</p><p>Uber has an awesome infrastructure and operations team that helps with some of the management of our web servers. From an architecture standpoint, a couple of things that are pretty important to our scale is intelligent caching and microservices. Uber’s backend is broken down into microservices that talk through a couple of different protocols. We open sourced a very efficient protocol called TChannel.</p><p>I’d say that those microservices are really what enable us to be so scalable. We focus on optimizing each one and then we make many calls in parallel. We’re never blocking on a series of services to give us an answer on something. Caching at the API layer allows us to limit the number of things we have to look up during a single request.</p>",

The groups specifically call out Google’s YouTube and YouTube Kids, Disney-owned Maker Studios, Dreamworks’ AwesomenessTV and others, as being involved in this damaging practice.</p><p>“Influencer marketing,” by way of background, is referencing the way popular content creators and video stars will distribute ads and other commercial material, without properly disclosing that they’re being compensated for doing so.</p><p>In particular, the consumer watchdog organizations complain that these sorts of ads are pushing toys, junk food and other products toward kids, who can’t yet tell the difference between paid advertising and content.</p><p>By law, existing FTC regulations require that advertisements are disclosed. But the groups say that many influencers fail to make the proper disclosures, leading kids to pester parents for costly goods and unhealthy foods.</p><p>The complaint alleges that several MCNs (multi-channel networks), including Collab Creators, Wild Brain, Maker Studios and AwesomenessTV, all distribute this sort of content across social media and YouTube. It even names some of the more popular “influencer” YouTube channels where this content can today be found, like EvanTubeHD, Baby Ariel, Meghan McCarthy, the Eh Bee Family, and Bratayley.</p><p>These channels each have millions of subscribers, which means they have similar reach as many kids’ TV programs, where rules are much stricter than online.</p><p>In one example, Baby Ariel and her family sample Jelly Belly jelly beans as part of a game; In another, an EvanTubeHD video shows an unboxing of a new Lego Police Patrol Boat. While this content obviously appeals to kids, the relationship between the influencer and advertiser is not disclosed. Meanwhile, the platforms where these videos are found – like YouTube and YouTube Kids, for example – financially benefit from the videos’ popularity, thanks to ad revenues.</p><p>“Parents have no idea that the adorable ‘friends’ their children like to watch unbox toys are really stealth marketers,” CCFC’s Executive Director Josh Golin said in statement, calling on the FTC to clamp down on this marketing practice.</p><p>This is not the first time these groups have gone after online influencers for the same problem. In prior FTC complaints, the groups have complained about these same deceptive ads on YouTube and YouTube Kids. In particular, the YouTube Kids app is being marketed to children 5 and under, which makes this type of advertising especially egregious.</p><p>And the groups have filed FTC complaints related to the hidden junk food ads on YouTube Kids – which means the food and drink advertisers are violating their own self-regulatory pledges they made as members of the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI).</p><p>There’s nothing really new in terms of the nature of the complaint this time around. Instead, the new complaint represents the groups’ now-expanded focus beyond YouTube and its properties to go after the MCNs more directly.</p><p>Golin says the FTC has not yet ruled on any of the groups’ prior complaints.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sometimes the government, not the startup, wins. Case in point: Fixed, the company that began as a tool to help drivers fight their parking tickets through the use technology, has been acquired. Fixed had struggled to get cities to accept its submissions, having faced everything from being blocked from cities’ ticket websites to agencies simply unplugging their fax machine so Fixed couldn’t reach them. In fact, the company had to shut down its parking ticket business last fall to focus on traffic citations instead, due to pushback from local government agencies and its lack of resources to fight back.</p><p>The idea for Fixed was ingenious. It automated users’ ability to contest parking tickets, just by having drivers snap a photo of their ticket with their smartphone camera. Then, Fixed’s mobile app would check for a variety of common errors and craft a customized letter to the city on the user’s behalf. It even tapped into Google Street View to see if the city had the proper signage in place in the area where the ticket was received.</p><p>And if the ticket was legit, Fixed could also help automate its payment so users could avoid the drudgery of having to use the city’s often outdated website.</p><p>But local government, which relies on parking fines to fill its coffers, didn’t care for an app whose aim was to help users get out of paying their fines. Thus, Fixed’s “win” rate was fairly low – around 20 to 30 percent of tickets it contested were adjusted to the user’s favor. (Fixed once claimed that the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency wouldn’t always dismiss tickets even when it found an issue that should have made the ticket invalid).</p><p>Fixed was eventually blocked in October 2015 in San Francisco, Oakland and L. A. even though it knew how to work around the blocks, it couldn’t do so due to the increase in engineering time and resources that would be required. That’s when it began to focus on traffic citations.</p><p>The company built a system that would analyze a traffic ticket, then help explain to the customer what the impact of that would be, financially. This was useful because most customers only think in terms of the fine amount, not the long-term damage due to the points that tickets added to your license and subsequent increases in insurance.</p><p>It could then connect customers with attorneys who could help, and at reduced rates because Fixed was automating a lot of the onboarding process for the law firms. It was working with some 20 attorneys in a dozen states.</p><p>This ended up attracting the attention of Lawgix, a multi-state law firm that’s actually part tech company. (The person running the tech side of the business, Eric Sonnier, also knew of Fixed due to having been in the same Y Combinator class).</p><p>Fixed was processing around 500 tickets per week, and the lawyers it referred customers to could help with points removal in roughly 90 percent of cases. They also helped reduce fines about half the time.</p><p>Lawgix had built technology systems for the backend of the litigation process – like those that handled court dates and processed the results of court actions. Now it will tack Fixed’s technology onto the front-end, to onboard new clients and expand the reach of Fixed’s app to 17 states.</p><p>The acquisition, however, is for the technology, not the talent. And while it’s good to know the tech will live on, it’s not really the sort of outcome Fixed founder David Hegarty desired.</p><p>Fixed was in the process of fundraising in September, but when the cities blocked the app, a new round was no longer an option. Though Uber has had some impact on investors previously skittish to fund services that take on current regulations, many are still cautious about getting into this sort of business.</p><p>And fighting regulations introduces another piece of friction to growing a startup, Hegarty says. “It’s hard enough to get a business up and running when it’s plain sailing,” he notes.</p><p>Plus, after pivoting to traffic tickets, Fixed then began to bump up against the Bar Association, too.</p><p>“We started rubbing up against the existing attorneys in that system, and they would file complaints to the Bar Association about us,” Hegarty says. “We had worked with an ethics attorney in L. A. to stay in compliance with all these rules and regulations, but it just became really hard. It was another stranglehold on the business,” he says.</p><p>Lawgix won’t deal with those same issues, as it won’t have to worry about things like putting in disclosures that the information Fixed offers isn’t “legal advice,” for example. People could no longer argue that Fixed’s help with tickets is like practicing law, and therefore is a problem. Lawgix is a law firm, which makes it okay. And being part tech company may make it a perfect fit for Fixed, too.</p><p>Fixed had raised $1.8 million in seed funding, including from Mark Cuban on Shark Tank, Dave Morin’s Slow Ventures, Structure VC, Paul Buchheit, rapper Nas, and others.</p>",

    "content": "<p>SaaS entrepreneurs are bombarded with blog posts with an array of metrics and variables on which they need to focus in order to build their companies. Within the world of customer success, there are so many metrics that are touted: gross churn, net churn, logo churn, renewal rates, NPS score, etc.</p><p>To better understand which customer success metrics most impact growth, we examined a subset of companies in SaaSRadar, McKinsey’s database of pre-IPO SaaS companies. Our conclusion is that gross churn, by far, is the most impactful metric.</p><p>Most public SaaS companies report net churn, which represents how your existing customer base is growing or shrinking from one period to the next. Your net churn is a combination of gross churn (how stable is the current revenue stream from existing customers) and expansion revenue (how much additional revenue are you generating from up-sells or cross-sells to your existing customers). While the fastest-growing SaaS companies have low gross churn and do a great job of expansion revenue, the chart below shows that the more important metric of the two is gross churn.</p><p>Put simply, if you can more effectively keep the customers/revenue you’ve already signed up — that, on average, has more of an impact than selling more to your existing customers.</p><p>The one exception to this rule are companies with self-serve customer acquisition models and usage-based pricing models where up-sells are essentially no touch (meaning no additional investment from the sales team). Twilio, which recently went public, is a good example of this.</p><p>High-growth companies make sure to protect their highest-revenue customers:  Gross churn matters more than logo churn.</p><p>If you are selling to SMBs, one of the challenges you have is that small businesses tend to “go out of business,” which by definition will increase your churn rates. If you are selling to enterprises, you don’t have this problem. So what are the best-in-class metrics for SMB-focused businesses versus enterprise-focused businesses?</p><p>The data in the exhibit below shows that the top quartile SMB-focused companies have annual customer churn of 31 percent and annual revenue churn of 16 percent. In contrast, the enterprise-focused companies have annual customer churn rate of 14 percent and revenue churn of 5 percent. The key message here is to benchmark yourself on both net churn but, more importantly, gross churn, from a sample set of companies that are selling to a similar customer base as you, because the best-in-class numbers can vary so wildly.</p><p>The further implication is that the fastest-growing companies focus on protecting their highest revenue customers more so than protecting all of their customers. It may be okay to lose some logos — particularly in the evolution of a startup where many early customers may not be a good fit for your solution today. Losing any kind of customer will feel painful, but as a SaaS CEO, you have to be okay with some set of your “off spec” customers churning while you double down on your most important “sweet spot” customers.</p><p>Her are five recommendations to reduce gross churn:</p><p>Invest in building a right-sized customer success organization. Top performing enterprise-focused companies invest higher than average number of FTEs in customer success in order to drive down gross churn. In contrast, the best-performing SMB-focused companies have fewer FTEs than the average as a result of leveraging technology and self-service products to create a more efficient customer success and onboarding experience.</p><p>Focus not just on technology, but on people. The best companies recognize that while they are selling technology, the ultimate decisions to renew or cancel the service are driven by people.  Enterprise-focused companies need to ensure they know who the executive sponsor is and take action if that sponsor leaves. SMB-focused companies need to ensure they have regular, automated ways to contact the key buyer within the organization.</p><p>Use predictive modeling and alerting to anticipate future success problems in advance. Analytics and predictive modeling can help to identify drivers of churn, prioritize resources and alert contact strategy for customers that are both high-risk and high-value.</p><p>Measure, measure, measure. Three categories of customer success metrics should be tracked: lagging indicators, activity indicators and leading indicators. Lagging indicators include metrics such as renewal rate and expansion. Activity indicators include a customer’s engagement in the product or service. Leading indicators include measures of customer satisfaction, such as net promoter score (NPS).</p><p>Let your customer success organization be the “learning engine.” Ultimately, the customer success organization cannot live in a vacuum. A strong customer success organization becomes the company’s “learning engine” — relaying their findings from the field to the sales, product and marketing teams. This feedback loop is critical to drive improvements to the overall product, value proposition and delivery model.</p>",

This announcement comes about half a year after the company raised $15 million with the stated goal of releasing exactly this kind of service (after previously raising $120 million).</p><p>Joyent argues that while Docker brings lots of new efficiencies to the development and deployment process, it also introduces new complexities, because you have to manage multiple containers and hosts, and wrangle with networking implementations and security issues.</p><p>Overall, Triton is made up of a number of components which include some of Joyent’s existing offerings. There are the Docker containers at the center of the service, which are managed by the Triton Docker Engine and run on top of Joyent’s Triton Container Hypervisor. In addition, Triton features its own software-defined networking infrastructure service and a DevOps Portal for managing the service.</p><p>Here is how Triton fits into Joyent’s overall offerings (including its open source tools):</p><p>Joyent promises that Triton allows developers and devops teams to treat the entire datacenter as a single container host while it manages the complexities in the background. At the same time, Joyent promises that its SmartOS virtualization layer allows it to bring bare metal-like performance to Docker containers. The company also notes how Triton offers real-time monitoring and post-mortem debugging tools, as well as the ability to easily resize and scale containers as needed.</p><p>One thing that sets Joyent’s service apart from similar platforms is that the company charges per containers and not per virtual machine. As part of this launch, the company is also introducing a new instance with lower pricing compared to its previous low-end machines.</p><p>“[It’s] Joyent’s ability to securely run containers on multi-tenant bare-metal brings with it performance and pricing advantages that put it in a class by itself,” Joyent product manager Casey Bisson told me yesterday when I asked him how Joyent’s service fit in with existing Docker management tools like Google’s Kubernetes. “The network virtualization offers similar convenience and performance advantages that can’t be matched by alternative solutions.”</p><p>He also argues that Joyent’s SmartOS “is a key factor in our ability to deliver these advantages, but the expression of these advantages to host Docker containers represents new work and a number of significant innovations not seen elsewhere.”</p><p>Triton is now available as a preview on for Joyent’s public cloud customers. Enterprises that want to run the service on-premise can also deploy Triton Enterprise in their own data centers.</p>",

They believe they can put this data to work to help customers link subscription revenue to key business metrics. What’s more, they think they are in a much better position to do this than traditional accounting software from vendors like SAP or Oracle, which use traditional GAAP accounting methods.</p><p>“Insights allows our customers to combine financial, demographic and behavioral data that has been traditionally siloed. It represents the next major step these [subscription-based] companies will go through,” Zuora CEO Tien Tzuo told TechCrunch.</p><p>Like Zendesk, which recently launched Zendesk Explore to provide customer insight across the company, Zuora wants to make more practical use of its data. For Zuora, that means finding ways to combine the subscription data with other relevant customer information. Since Zuora is built on Salesforce, it should come as no surprise that you can combine Zuora data with Salesforce customer data to build a more complete picture of the customer.</p><p>The idea is to allow users to proactively make use of all this data to find possible issues and understand customers better to improve their businesses. That could mean trying to upsell a happy customer when the time is right, while making it easy to upgrade, or it could involve identifying customers giving signals they might be ready to unsubscribe to proactively try to prevent that.</p><p>In the subscription business, losing customers is measured by the churn rate. You want as low a churn rate as possible. If you can use data to prevent churn, you are going to have a more successful subscription business. This ability to use the data to actively engage the customer has the potential to be a huge differentiator.</p><p>“In next phase of the subscription economy, customers will not be satisfied with backward metrics. They want information to drive the business,” Tzuo said.</p><p>Zuora launched in 2007, long before most people had even heard of subscription revenue, but founder Tien Tzuo had a vision of a changing software market that was ahead of its time. Today, the software business (along with many others) has caught up with the vision — and Zuora wants to help customers understand their subscription businesses better.</p><p>Zuora customers include Ford, Surf Air and Trulia, as well as more traditional SaaS companies like Box and Zendesk. The company has raised over $240 million and has a valuation of over $1 billion.</p>",

These elementary AIs only know what we tell them, and if that data carries a bias of any kind, so too will the system trained on it. Google is looking to avoid such awkward and potentially serious situations systematically with a method it calls “Equality of Opportunity.”</p><p>Machine learning systems are basically prediction engines that learn the characteristics of various sets of data and then, given a new bit of data, assign it to one of several buckets: an image recognition system might learn the difference between different types of cars, assigning each picture a label like “sedan,” “pickup truck,” “bus,” etc.</p><p>Google unleashes deep learning tech on language with Neural Machine Translation</p><p>Yahoo open sources its porn-detecting neural network</p><p>Machine learning could automate screening kids for speech and language disorders</p><p>Mistakes are inevitable: consider a BRAT or El Camino.

People who fall outside the common parameters are disproportionately likely to fall afoul of what the system learns are good bets from the rest of the data set — that’s just how machine learning operates.</p><p>“When group membership coincides with a sensitive attribute, such as race, gender, disability, or religion, this situation can lead to unjust or prejudicial outcomes,” wrote Google Brain’s Moritz Hardt in a blog post. “Despite the need, a vetted methodology in machine learning for preventing this kind of discrimination based on sensitive attributes has been lacking.”</p><p>Hardt, alongside his colleagues Eric Price and Nathan Srebro, wrote a paper describing a way to avoid this kind of outcome. There’s a lot of stuff like this:</p><p>But the gist is this: When there’s a desired outcome and a possibility of one of those attributes incorrectly affecting someone’s likelihood of getting it, the algorithm adjusts itself so there is a similar proportion of those outcomes regardless of that attribute. It’s really no trouble for the computer — you train it so it values parity between non-relevant attributes.</p><p>You can get an intuitive sense of it with these interactive charts the team made. It’s not about goosing the numbers to be politically correct; the resulting model will actually be more accurate in its predictions. And if one of these attributes is relevant — say you’re calculating the likelihood of someone having this or that religion based on their location, or making medical predictions that differ between sexes — you just include it.</p><p>It’s a thoughtful line of inquiry for Google to be pursuing, and highly relevant as well, considering how machine learning is pervading so many industries so quickly. It’s important to be well aware of the limitations and risks of new technologies, and this is a subtle but important one.</p><p>The authors will be presenting their paper at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference — as good a reason as any to go to Barcelona.</p>",

The standalone application turns all of YouTube’s content into an immersive experience, even if the videos weren’t built for VR viewing. To do so, YouTube VR will display standard videos in a virtual movie screen in app’s new theater mode. Of course, 360 degree videos on YouTube will work best in this app.</p><p>In the theater mode, the video itself fills the main portion of the screen, while video information – like the title and description – is off on one side. The other side of the screen displays your queue so you can see what’s coming up next. Player controls are down at the bottom.</p><p>This way, you can watch and browse at the same time, says Google.</p><p>The app also includes other features like voice search, support for spatial audio, and the ability to sign in to your YouTube account so you can follow your subscriptions and view your playlists.</p><p>Today, much of the content on YouTube is not optimized for VR, but Google believes the format will become a more popular means of storytelling.</p><p>That said, the company is investing in the technology by seeding the network with VR content. It has been helping YouTube creators gain access to VR equipment in YouTube Spaces, as well as learn how to use it to film in 360 degrees.</p><p>At launch, that means there’s already a number of videos to watch in the new VR app. The company calls out a few examples of those across genres, including videos from beauty blogger Meredith Foster, Tastemade’s cooking videos, HuffPost RYOT’s breaking news, as well as others from Curiscope, Natural History Museum in London, StyleHaul, and Fitness Blender, to name a few.

Today, the company is extending this program with the launch of two new APIs.</p><p>The company launched its API program back in 2012 with a service that allowed developers to send photo print requests to its in-store photo kiosks. Since then, the company expanded this program to allow developers to plug into its Balance Rewards loyalty program (for apps that track fitness, for example) and for services that enable prescription refills and transfers. As the company told me, the prescription refill API now helps fill one prescription per second from mobile devices.</p><p>In total, Walgreens now works with 275 partners that have implemented its services through its APIs.</p><p>The two new APIs will allow developers to access Walgreens store locations (and the features of those stores) and access its digital coupons from third-party apps.</p><p>As Walgreens developer evangelist Drew Schweinfurth and senior product manager Kristin Marx told me, the company previously sent an Excel or CSV file to developers who needed access to its store locations. That’s not just an archaic method of sharing this kind of information, but because the file was only updated once per month, the information was often outdated.</p><p>As for the Digital Offers API, Walgreens tells me that developers who want to integrate this will be able to allow their users to “clip” coupons to their loyalty card and discounts will then be automatically applied at checkout.</p><p>The company had built internal APIs for powering both its store locator and coupons in its own application, and now decided that it was time to extend this to others. To do this, Walgreens partnered with Apigee, which also powers its other APIs.</p><p>“For 2016, we want to focus on looking at extending services that help developers make innovative applications,” Schweinfurth explained to me. That’s a process Walgreens started last year. The company also recently switched the checkout feature of its Photo Prints API from an SDK to a RESTful API, for example, which the company says is helping it drive more transactions.</p><p>As Apigee senior vice president Ed Anuff told me, the company looks at Walgreens as an example for “how traditional companies get APIs right.” Walgreen’s earliest API efforts were on how they could enable their own mobile apps and then, over time, that work lead to opening its APIs to third-party developers, too. “What we see is that mobile and APIs go hand-in-hand,” Anuff said. “Walgreen’s got more ambitions from [its] mobile development.” In more general terms, he also argued that traditional brick-and-mortar businesses like Walgreens need to think about how they can strategically build digital experiences that improve their customers’ journey — even if that means extending those outside of their own apps.</p>",

The two services launched there in September, along with Apple Music (which is still available).</p><p>The shutdown was ordered by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SARFT), which oversees content in those mediums.</p><p>TechCrunch has contacted Apple for comment. The company told the New York Times in a statement that, “We hope to make books and movies available again to our customers in China as soon as possible.”</p><p>As the report points out, this may mark a turnaround for Apple’s business in China, since it has been given an unusual amount of freedom for a foreign tech company. As a result, Apple has been able to turn the country into its second-largest market after the United States. This has been mainly driven by iPhone sales and iOS app revenue, but Apple is also keen to sell software services, like Apple Pay and its entertainment stores, to the country’s consumers. In fact, China, which is already the No. 2 market for iOS revenue, may overtake the U. S. in terms of app revenue this year if its current growth rate is allowed to continue.</p><p>At the same time, Apple is still subject to scrutiny. For example, Apple’s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, recently said during a Congressional subcommittee meeting that the company refused a request from the Chinese government to access the iPhone’s source code.</p><p>Furthermore, Apple is one of the eight U. S. tech giants named in 2014 by China’s state media as a “guardian warrior,” or companies that have a big enough influence on the country’s information infrastructure to warrant extra attention (the other seven are Cisco, IBM, Google, Qualcomm, Intel, Oracle and Microsoft).</p><p>The closure of iBooks and iTunes Movies in China, however, may be primarily a business issue instead of cybersecurity one. The SARFT and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, recently announced a new set of broad regulations designed to make it more difficult for companies with foreign owners to publish online content.</p><p>Among other restrictions, they require foreign companies to find a domestic partner in addition to receiving government approval. This means Chinese Internet leaders like Tencent (which already runs the country’s largest online book business), Baidu and Alibaba would have less competition. That doesn’t mean they get a free ride, however — all three are also under stringent government control.</p>",

    "content": "<p>It’s been almost five years since we heard that “software is eating the world.” The number of SaaS applications has exploded and there is a rising wave of software innovation in the area of APIs that provide critical connective tissue and increasingly important functionality. There has been a proliferation of third-party API companies, which is fundamentally changing the dynamics of how software is created and brought to market.</p><p>The application programming interface (API) has been a key part of software development for decades as a way to develop for a specific platform, such as Microsoft Windows. More recently, newer platform providers, from Salesforce to Facebook and Google, have offered APIs that help the developer and have, in effect, created a developer dependency on these platforms.</p><p>Now, a new breed of third-party APIs are offering capabilities that free developers from lock-in to any particular platform and allow them to more efficiently bring their applications to market.</p><p>The monolithic infrastructure and applications that have powered businesses over the past few decades are giving way to distributed and modular alternatives. These rely on small, independent and reusable microservices that can be assembled relatively easily into more complex applications. As a result, developers can focus on their own unique functionality and surround it with fully functional, distributed processes developed by other specialists, which they access through APIs.</p><p>Developers realize that much of the functionality they need to build into an app is redundant to what many other companies are toiling over. They’ve learned not to expend precious resources on reinventing the wheel but instead to rely on APIs from the larger platforms, such as Salesforce, Amazon and, more recently, specialized developers. We’re still in the early innings of this shift to third-party APIs, but a number of promising examples illustrate how developers can turn to companies such as Stripe and Plaid for payment connectivity, Twilio for telephony, Factual for location-based data and Algolia for site search.</p><p>Indeed, the area is booming. On last check, ProgrammableWeb was providing searchable access to almost 15,000 APIs, with more being added on a daily basis. Developers can incorporate these APIs into their software projects and get to market much more quickly than going it alone.</p><p>While getting to market more quickly at a lower cost is a huge advantage, there is an even more important advantage: Companies that focus on their core capabilities develop differentiated functionality, their “secret sauce,” at higher velocity.</p><p>Another advantage is third-party APIs are often flat-out better. They work better and provide more flexibility than APIs that are built internally. Companies often underestimate the amount of work that goes into building and maintaining the functionality that they can now get as a third-party API. Finally, third-party API developers have more volume and access to a larger data set that creates network effects.</p><p>These network effects can manifest themselves in everything from better pricing to superior SLA’s to using AI to mine best practices and patterns across the data. For example, Menlo’s portfolio company Signifyd offers fraud analysis as an API. They aggregate retail transactions across hundreds of companies, which allows them to understand a breadth of fraud markers better than any individual customer could.</p><p>Releasing software as an API allows those companies to pursue a number of different adoption routes. Rather than trying to sell specific industry verticals or use cases, often the customer is a developer, leading to an extremely low-friction sales process. The revenue model is almost always recurring, which leads to an inherently scalable business model as the end customers’ usage increases. While the ecosystem of API-based companies is early in its evolution, we believe the attributes of these companies will combine to create ultimately more capital-efficient and profitable business models.</p><p>This opportunity is not limited to new upstarts. Existing developers may have the opportunity to expose their own unique functionality as an API, morphing their product from application to platform. Some outstanding companies have built API businesses that match or exceed their original focus: Salesforce reportedly generates 50 percent of its revenues through APIs, eBay nearly 60 percent and Expedia a whopping 90 percent.</p><p>The model is attractive to entrepreneurs and investors. Rather than trying to create the next hot app and having to invest heavily in marketing and distribution before validating scalable demand, it may make more sense to build a bounded set of functionality and become an arms merchant for other developers.</p><p>The API model creates a compelling route to market that if successful can scale capital efficiently and gain a network effect over time. Currently, there are 9 million developers working on private APIs; as that talent sees the opportunity to create companies versus functionalities, we may see a significant shift to public API development (where there are currently only 1.2 million developers).</p><p>In the past, the biggest companies were those closest to the data (e.g. a system of record), able to impose a tax, or lock-in to their platform. In the API economy, the biggest companies may be the ones that aggregate the most data smartly and open it up to others.</p><p>This enables new types of competitive barriers, as in Twilio’s ability to negotiate volume discounts from carriers that no individual developer could obtain, or the volume pricing that Stripe enjoys by pooling payments across many developers. Companies like Usermind (a Menlo Ventures portfolio company) show great promise in allowing enterprises to move beyond their single-application silos by creating workflows and simplifying the API connections between their existing SaaS applications.</p><p>While the ecosystem for API startups is a</p>",

    "content": "<p>Grana, a two-year-old online fashion retailer based in Hong Kong, has announced that it has raised $10 million in fresh funding led by Alibaba’s entrepreneurship fund.</p><p>This is the startup’s Series A round, and it follows $6 million in previous seed funding. The round is led by Alibaba’s Hong Kong-based fund, which was announced last year, and it also includes participation from existing investors Golden Gate Ventures (Singapore) and MindWorks Ventures (Hong Kong).</p><p>In an interview with TechCrunch, co-founder and CEO Luke Grana said that the new funding will be put to work expanding his company’s selection of products — all of which are own-brand — and growing its reach beyond the 12 countries that Grana currently ships to. In particular, Grana is focused on expanding its business in the U. S., which is already its largest market alongside Hong Kong, just ahead of Australia and Singapore.</p><p>Grana isn’t providing specific business figures at this point, other than to say that it is growing at an average of 15 percent month-on-month. Return rates are single-digital percent, with a flat fee — US$10, SG$10 or HK$20 — charged for a collection direct from the customer.</p><p>“We’ve experienced really strong growth [and had a] good couple of years that we need to continue,” Grana, who was born and raised in Sydney, Australia, said.</p><p>Grana sells its own-brand fashion items exclusively through its website. The company produces its own high-quality fashion products, sourcing its fabric from Italy, Peru, China and other parts of the world. It has an offline store in Hong Kong and has run temporary ‘pop-up’ stores in four countries, so far. Grana just moved into a new 18,000 square foot warehouse in Hong Kong where all product is stored and shipped, while its entire 50 person team is based in Hong Kong. Keeping the business in a single country may seem strange when its customer base is global, but Grana explained it is all about efficiency everyone involved.</p><p>“There are no distributors, middle men or warehouses, so we ship direct to the customer. We cut out all the inefficiencies that we can [so that] customers get a really great product at a quality that they’ve never seen before,” he said.</p><p>When it comes to business, Grana explained that Hong Kong’s status as the world’s largest air cargo hub, and DHL’s shipping rates, mean that its next-day/two-day delivery service to the U. S. and other countries are on par with any local service. That’s based on both speed for the customer and price for Grana. For that reason, Grana hasn’t opened warehouses in the U.S. or other places to store product locally.</p><p>In terms of passing on costs to the customer, Grana said most fashion items carry a mark-up of around seven-to-eight times the cost due to the chain of process. But by stripping out the aforementioned middlemen and fees, Grana — he said — sells at just 2-3X mark-up.</p><p>“We travel the world to find the best fabric to make modern wardrobe essentials: great quality items that a large market can wear,” Grana added. “We want to replicate ASOS but using our own brand.”</p><p>There’s no plan to introduce its items via offline retailers, nor will Grana become a sales front for other like-minded, independent fashion brands. The goal is to continue on as is, but grow its reach and scope.</p><p>Global expansion is on the agenda for 2017, but CEO Luke Grana isn’t being too specific on exactly which countries will be targeted. China is one confirmed name on the list with a soft launch likely to happen “sometime next year.” For that move, Grana is likely to shift its distribution model somewhat and align itself with existing e-commerce portals to gain reach. Grana hinted that Alibaba’s Taobao marketplace could be an ideal entrance point, and he said his company is working closely with the e-commerce giant to weigh up its method of entry into China.</p><p>“There’s a really good fit with Alibaba, strategically we are leaning a lot about e-commerce in China and getting logistics and infrastructure support,” he said.</p><p>On the product side, Grana’s range spans 10 fabrics, 90 styles and 3,000 SKUs across shorts, sweaters, swimwear and underwear in both men’s and women’s fashion. Grana said the company plans to expand to sportswear, bags and accessories early next year, while he’d like to also begin producing and selling items like shoes in the longer term.</p>",

If correct, that would surpass Snapdeal rival Flipkart’s purchase of Myntra last year, which we understand was $330 million.</p><p>Snapdeal said FreeCharge will continue to “function as an independent platform and all aspects of [its] shopping experience will remain intact,” though it plans to extend the integration between the two services.</p><p>FreeCharge is a service that rewards users with coupons when they top up their phone credit or pay utility bills. It claims more than 15 million users in India — it recently raised an $80 million Series C and counts Sequoia Capital among its investors. (In total, it raised $115 million.) FreeCharge is particularly interesting because a high proportion of its business comes from mobile devices (85 percent), while more than half of its customers have payment cards associated with their accounts — making them ripe for conversion into regular Snapdeal customers.</p><p>That focus on mobile makes the deal a potentially key one for Snapdeal, which is battling Flipkart and Amazon for supremacy in India’s e-commerce market. Sales of smartphones in India doubled from 156 million units in 2013 to 364 million in 2014 — that growth is set to continue and take India past 500 million internet users in the coming few years, the bulk of whom will be on mobile devices.</p><p>Given the promise of the market, India’s top e-commerce firms are raising funding and expanding their services to capture larger chunks of the market and position themselves to take advantage of the growing audience of internet-connected consumers.</p><p>Amazon pledged $2 billion to grow its business in India, while Flipkart and Snapdeal both raised significant rounds of funding from investors last year. Snapdeal has spent some of its capital on a number of acquisitions of late — including loan service Rupeepower, recommendations platform Wishpicker and luxury goods marketplace Exclusively. Each one, however, has been kept undisclosed, just like the SnapCharge deal.</p><p>Mobile payments are becoming a key battleground as India’s e-commerce leaders mature, and earlier today MobiKwik landed $25 million from a string of investors that included American Express and Cisco. The company is aiming to reach 100 million registered users of its mobile wallet by next year, and is targeting a $100 million Series C round for the second half of this year.</p><p>Finally: Credit is due to both Snapdeal and FreeCharge for the way they playfully revealed their deal on Twitter:</p>",

I think it’s really cool tech, and I think provides some demonstrable benefits; but I think those benefits are only gained in specific instances. You’re not going to be using a virtualized desktop at home, and neither will your parents, any time soon.</p><p>Obviously the virtualization companies want us to all think this is a done deal, and that virtualized computing is the way of computing from here on out.

TechCrunch understands that Xiaomi will begin selling its first mainstream product in the U.S. — an Android set-top box — as soon as next month.</p><p>The Mi Box was announced and demoed all the way back in May at Google I/O, but so far the company has remained quiet on when it will go on sale. A source inside Xiaomi, however, told TechCrunch that it will be made available to consumers in the U. S. and other selected markets in “early Q4 2016.” That could indeed mean October.</p><p>The price has also been kept quiet to date, but we also understand that the box will cost less than $100.</p><p>The device is very much like the Apple TV, but powered by Android. It is capable of beaming 4K video at 60 FPS with support for Dolby Digital Plus audio playback. In addition, there’s HDMI 2.0a compatibility, a quad-core ARM processor, Mali 450 GPU and 2GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. There’s even a controller for playing Android games on your TV set.</p><p>All in all, it promises to offer some serious bang for buck as we’ve come to expect from Xiaomi’s gamut of products, which span laptops, drones, air purifiers, scooters and even a smart rice cooker.</p><p>The Mi Box is not a smartphone, of course, but it does represent a significant first foray into the U. S. for Xiaomi, which now sells phones in more than 10 countries worldwide. Xiaomi started out in its native China before expanding across Asia with local operations in places like India, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia. Last summer it went beyond Asia with a move into Brazil.</p><p>All the while, it has avoided the U. S.. Many pundits have speculated that its lack of patents are the major barrier. Xiaomi has bulked up on patents — including a deal with Microsoft — which could hasten its arrival. That’s important since competition is tough in China, where Huawei recently topped Xiaomi on sales, and in other key markets like India.</p><p>Xiaomi’s head of international — former Android lead Hugo Barra — recently told Bloomberg that the company is preparing to move into the U. S. smartphone market “in the near future,” but that isn’t likely to be all that soon. The Mi Box will be an interesting first test of the water for Xiaomi, while also helping it build a brand and generate awareness among U.S. consumers. The company’s only other effort has been the online sale of phone accessories in the U.S. and Europe for more than one year.</p>",

At the same time, they hint at problems to come for some startups.</p><p>The survey, which analyzed the valuations and terms of financings for 149 Bay Area companies that raised capital in the third quarter, showed that 71 percent of those financings were “up” rounds, meaning the price per share of the company increased over its last round. Another 14 percent were down rounds, meaning the opposite happened, and 15 percent were “flat,” so the companies’ valuations didn’t change, despite that they raised more funding.</p><p>The picture was almost exactly the same as in the second quarter of the year, when 74 percent of rounds were up rounds and 13 percent were flat, but the third-quarter marks the fourth quarter in a row that venture valuation metrics have declined, which has the survey’s author, attorney Barry Kramer, following the development closely.</p><p>“It’s not like things have fallen dramatically,” he told us by phone on Friday. “Basically, we were close to all-time highs in 2014 and 2015, and valuations are now at their 12-year averages, so you could argue that we’re in a healthy regression to the mean.”</p><p>Of greater concern to Kramer is that the number of deals has also gone down over the past four quarters. In the second quarter, for example, Fenwick was able to analyze 195 financings for Silicon Valley companies — or 30 percent more than in the third quarter.</p><p>That could mean that only stronger companies are getting financed. At the same time, it does raise questions about what happens to all the startups that raised funds in 2014 and 2015 and haven’t raised again. “Are they kind of starting to run on fumes, and we’re a quarter or so away from seeing something more dramatic?” Kramer asks. “I’d feel better if deal volumes weren’t falling.”</p><p>You can check out the entire survey here.</p>",

A couple of years ago, the company extended that capability to enable customers to control the devices where employees could access those cloud applications.</p><p>Today’s announcement is an acknowledgement that the programs themselves are made up of multiple services within an app, such as combining Google Maps for location with Twilio for communication and Braintree for payments. While it feels like a single program, it’s actually crossing multiple gateways to deliver the experience.</p><p>“This really lets our customers extend control to APIs,” Okta CEO Todd McKinnon told TechCrunch.</p><p>This could work in a couple of ways, he said. APIs often require administrative or programmer-level access and Okta can help companies manage this access by policy. It also gives them an audit trail of anyone who has tried to access the API gateway.</p><p>“Hackers are good at finding the weakest link, and maybe they could find the system doesn’t have the API locked down. Having a system to guarantee there is a strong access policy, in a lot of cases can tighten the weakest link,” McKinnon said.</p><p>Okta’s API system uses OAuth 2.0 access control in conjunction with Okta’s policy engine and administrative access control panel. It has also partnered with API access management vendors like Apigee and MuleSoft.</p><p>Okta is a company at a crossroads. It was just last September that it announced a healthy $75 million round on a $1.2 billion valuation, propelling it into the heady unicorn club. The company has raised a hefty $230 million since inception in 2009, and at last year’s funding announcement suggested an IPO could be coming in the next 12-18 months.</p><p>A year later, the tech IPO market has been slow, and McKinnon is being cagier about going public, saying he can’t comment on a possible date.</p><p>“I will say that if anyone gives you a date, it probably means they are not going public. In general, over the last few years, as we have gotten closer to being a public company, we have looked at what companies are doing well and are being fairly valued [in the public markets].”</p><p>He says that the biggest change he’s seen is that the market doesn’t value growth as it once did and companies burning cash are being punished. “In that context, we are going to make the best decisions about how fast we are growing, how much cash we are burning and so forth,” he said.</p><p>It’s hard to know what that all means, but they are still within that 12-18 month window McKinnon referenced last year.</p>",

For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you may receive containing marketing could include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications, and we will honor the choices you make.</p><p>The move is a very notable one given that WhatsApp has always taken a very aggressive ‘no spam’ approach to its business. “Marketing” messages and “an offer for something that might interest you” could fall into the category of spam if not done right, context is key here.</p><p>Back in 2012, CEO and co-founder Jan Koum threw shade on a number of rival messaging companies which he claimed were “selling” ads to their users:</p><p>No one wakes up excited to see more advertising, no one goes to sleep thinking about the ads they’ll see tomorrow. We know people go to sleep excited about who they chatted with that day (and disappointed about who they didn’t). We want WhatsApp to be the product that keeps you awake… and that you reach for in the morning. No one jumps up from a nap and runs to see an advertisement.</p><p>Advertising isn’t just the disruption of aesthetics, the insults to your intelligence and the interruption of your train of thought. At every company that sells ads, a significant portion of their engineering team spends their day tuning data mining, writing better code to collect all your personal data, upgrading the servers that hold all the data and making sure it’s all being logged and collated and sliced and packaged and shipped out… And at the end of the day the result of it all is a slightly different advertising banner in your browser or on your mobile screen.</p><p>The irony here is that many of those in Koum’s firing line — WeChat, Line, and Kakao — weren’t pushing ads. They opted to make money by connecting businesses with users via “official accounts” that companies could pay to rent and promote. As we wrote before, the ability to reach users directly is a potentially a very powerful new tool — and it remains opt-in for uses. Actual banner ads are few and far between in the messaging space because they ruin the user experience and look alien inside chat, which is a highly personal and curated space.</p><p>It isn’t exactly clear whether WhatsApp’s ‘business communication’ push will be like official accounts, the company didn’t go into detail on the format. What it did say, however, is that it will begin sharing data, and in particular, users’ phone numbers, with Facebook — the company that acquired WhatsApp for a fee that ultimately rose to $22 million — which is a key way it hopes to make messages relevant and not spammy.</p><p>That’s quite a big admission, although WhatsApp users will be able to opt out of sharing their information with Facebook.</p><p>For those who go with the default, this is how your data will be put to work:</p><p>As part of the Facebook family of companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, this family of companies. We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings. This includes helping improve infrastructure and delivery systems, understanding how our Services or theirs are used, securing systems, and fighting spam, abuse, or infringement activities.

The I-PACE looks like a sensible small utility vehicle, with a five-door design and performance-tuned features including a target 0-60mph time of “around” four seconds, a 310+ mile range and a 50kW DC charging mechanism that helps it reclaim 80 percent of its total range capability from zero in just 90 minutes.</p><p>The I-PACE looks similar in dimensions to the Tesla Model X, with a broad rear-end designed for max boot space tapering to a slim and sleek rounded front. The idea was to make a car designed for sport-loving drivers, with a low, road-hugging cockpit and yet with tons of usable space for those in the family way.</p><p>I don’t understand why car companies can’t name their all-electric concepts without invoking all-caps, dashes or isolated letters, but the I-PACE does look like an intriguing machines, especially if it actually makes it to production in 2018. Besides the exterior design, which I think succeeds in being attractive as well as properly engineered for electric efficiency, I also like the cockpit concept, which uses two large touch screens combines with a digital instrument cluster display to create what Jaguar called a “flightdeck” for the driver.</p><p>The full length glass roof is also signature futuristic indulgence, which is not to say it’s unwelcome, but ultimately it’s a mighty nice looking vehicle in large part because it’s such a departure from Jaguar’s existing lineup in terms of design language.</p><p>Concept cars are still only that, of course, and a lot can happen between conception and production, but Jaguar definitely looks to be rolling in the right direction with its all-electric debut.</p>",

Today Facebook-owned chat service WhatsApp is officially launching video calling for its over 1 billion users worldwide on iOS, Android and Windows Phone. Its debut follows a series of reports from people who recently found the feature had been enabled in beta versions of WhatsApp on Android and on Windows Phone – an indication that a public debut was on the near horizon.</p><p>To use the new feature, WhatsApp users can hit the call button in the top right corner of a conversation, which will bring up an overlaid interstitial asking if you want to voice or video call the friend or family member you’re chatting with. To kick off the video call, you simply select the “video call” option from this screen.</p><p>During the call itself, you can switch between the forward-facing and rear camera, mute the call or press the red button to hang up. It seems the user interface varies slightly on Android and iPhone in terms of where the picture-in-picture video feed is displayed, as well as the buttons’ size, lineup and placement. (See images and video below).</p><p>WhatsApp already supports a number of standard features for communications apps, including group texting and voice calling. But the company says that video calling has remained one of its top feature requests from users.</p><p>With video calling, WhatsApp is belatedly catching up with a number of rivals, including Facebook’s own Messenger app, for example, as well as Skype, Apple’s FaceTime, Viber, LINE and Google’s recently launched Duo, to name a few.</p><p>Though a late entrant, WhatsApp still has a massive user base and the addition of the feature could help them from fleeing to other messaging and calling platforms. In addition, WhatsApp touts its cross-platform support as one of the reasons to use video calling in its app, instead of elsewhere.</p><p>“…we want to make these features available to everyone, not just those who can afford the most expensive new phones or live in countries with the best cellular networks,” the company said in its announcement, published today.</p><p>That’s a direct shot at things like FaceTime, which only works on Apple devices, as well as newer arrivals, like Google Duo, which only runs on later versions of iOS and Android (Jelly Bean and up, or iOS 9 and up).</p><p>You may not immediately see video calling in WhatsApp today, however. The rollout is staged, meaning it will arrive over the days ahead as it reaches the entire WhatsApp user base.</p><p>Video calling isn’t the only new addition to arrive recently. The company also rolled out two-factor authentication in some of its beta versions, hinting that its next big release could be a security-focused upgrade.</p><p>By retaining its simple interface but embracing more vivid connections beyond texting, WhatsApp could flourish with users no matter how they want to communicate</p>",

    "content": "<p>A number of top pundits are predicting that messaging apps will become ‘the new social media’ in 2015, and here’s some evidence to support that theory from Line, the chat app from Japan with over 500 million registered users and 170 million monthly actives.</p><p>Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney released a surprise collaboration with Kanye West on New Year’s Eve and I was particularly intrigued to observe how the British musician’s team promoted it online.</p><p>McCartney is popular on social media and was one of the first global ‘brands’ to jump aboard Line, which has dedicated a large part of its business to connecting companies with users for a fee.</p><p>His Facebook Page is closing in on 6.2 million likes, he has 2.17 million Twitter followers and (just) 187,000 followers on Instagram. But top billing is reserved for Line — where he has more than 10 million followers thanks to clever marketing and the use of stickers, which were offered free to fans who followed his account.</p><p>So how did he get on with engagement?</p><p>Instagram (which did not contain a link to the Soundcloud track): 15,600 likes</p><p>Line: 1,074 likes and 31 shares on public post, and push notifications to 10 million-plus fans (see below)</p><p>Twitter: the @paulmccartney account retweeted Kanye West’s tweet, but only after his team deleted the tweet below promoting the collaboration.</p><p>It isn’t clear why the tweet was deleted — perhaps it didn’t generate enough interest or McCartney’s team was happier to promote West’s tweet — but the overall engagement numbers are interesting.</p><p>Instagram comes out top in terms of sheer likes — despite a far smaller fan base. While the Instagram post makes mention that the song is available on McCartney’s website there is no URL so just a small fraction of those ‘likers’ may have actually taken action and listened to the song.</p><p>Facebook almost certainly got more attention — with traffic to Soundcloud, iTunes and its own video player — but the problem with posting updates to the social network is that Facebook’s own algorithm dictates just how many of McCartney’s fans will have seen it. There’s no way that it got served to all 6.2 million fans’ timelines unless McCartney’s team bought Facebook ad space.</p><p>Line does things differently, and McCartney’s post went out to his fans in two ways — via a public post and private chats.</p><p>The figures referred to above are from the post that McCartney’s account made to its Timeline, which — as the name suggests — is a Facebook-like chronological feed of public posts available within a dedicated menu inside the Line app. There, users see all updates from their Line friends and ‘official’ (corporate) accounts — like McCartney’s — which they have chosen to follow.</p><p>Line’s Timeline is governed entirely by each user without an algorithm, they only see items from people they follow and they can also block out accounts they wish to ignore. There is no way a brand can pay to plant their messages there, such as they can do on Facebook, Twitter and (now) Instagram.</p><p>But, most importantly, McCartney’s account also sent private chat messages to each of its 10 million-plus followers on Line. There is no metric to quantify the engagement of that action, but the fact that most of those fans will have gotten a push notification with the message and link to Soundcloud (just like an SMS) gives you an idea that it might well have been hugely effective.</p><p>Indeed, on Line, the Timeline post is just a bonus. Line said in 2013 that one-third of its registered users open their Timeline each month, and gauging the total reach of an official account on Line is impossible.</p><p>Writing for The Next Web back in 2013, I pointed out that chat apps like Line are a genuine threat to Twitter when it comes to advertising cash, and the Japanese company’s December acquisition of Microsoft’s MixRadio service has the potential to supercharge its appeal to artists and musicians worldwide once its proposed music streaming service goes live worldwide.</p><p>But Line isn’t the only chat app that is rivaling social networks. WeChat is becoming the de factor mobile internet in China — it is a must for any brands seeking to reach consumers there — while the same can be said of Kakao Talk in Korea, which is installed on over 90 percent of the country’s smartphones and also offers accounts for brands.</p><p>The appeal of chat apps for brands and advertisers won’t just be an Asian phenomenon in 2015, however.</p><p>Kik, an app that claims to have 40 percent of American’s youth on its service, recently let brands on to its platform, Snapchat is planning an Asia-style platform (and it just raised a truck load of cash). Even also-run Tango linked up with Spotify and offers a timeline-feature, while Rakuten-owned Viber introduced a platform for high-profile users in November.</p><p>Facebook Messenger is a notable absentee from this list, but perhaps not for long. David Marcus — the former PayPal CEO who heads up Facebook’s messaging business — told Wired that he wants to “reinvent messaging between people and businesses.”</p><p>That will almost certainly mean a system just like Line’s, which allows companies to pay for an account which users can subscribe to for updates. A premium tier on Line grants companies support for two-way conversations, thus turning them into customer sales representatives, and Facebook may adopt that too.</p><p>As for WhatsApp, the chat app Facebook bought for $19 billion, it offers an SMS replacement service rather than a platform and its founders seem to have no plan to change that.</p><p>Asia’s messaging apps have been around longer, and thus most have more mature business models that generate income by connecting brands with consumers, in addition to other non-marketing revenue streams such as games and stickers.</p><p>If 2014 was the year that the West wised up to the potential of messaging apps, then 2015 is the year that they’ll get smart and make money from them.</p>",

They call it Stream Saver, and yes, it applies to “unlimited” data plans.</p><p>All video streams it detects, once it goes into effect next year, will be limited to 1.5 Mbps. This should help them — sorry, you — conserve data and avoid running out of your limited unlimited data allowance.

    "content": "<p>Facebook built two versions of a fix for clickbait this year, and decided to trust algorithmic machine learning detection instead of only user behavior, a Facebook spokesperson tells TechCrunch.</p><p>Today Facebook was hit with more allegations its distribution of fake news helped elect Donald Trump. A new Gizmodo report saying Facebook shelved a planned update earlier this year that could have identified fake news because it would disproportionately demote right-wing news outlets.</p><p>Facebook directly denies this, telling TechCrunch “The article’s allegation is not true. We did not build and withhold any News Feed changes based on their potential impact on any one political party.”</p><p>However, TechCrunch has pulled more details from Facebook about the update Gizmodo discusses.</p><p>Back in January 2015, Facebook rolled out an update designed to combat hoax news stories, which demoted links that were heavily flagged as fake by users, and that were often deleted later by users who posted them. That system is still in place.</p><p>In August 2016, Facebook released another News Feed update designed to reduce clickbait stories. Facebook trained a machine learning algorithm by having humans identify common phrases in old news headlines of clickbait stories. The machine learning system then would identify and demote future stories that featured those clickbait phrases.</p><p>According to Facebook, it developed two different options for how the 2016 clickbait update would work. One was a classifier based off the 2015 hoax detector based on user reports, and another was the machine learning classifier built specifically for detecting clickbait via computer algorithm.</p><p>Facebook says it found the specially-made machine learning clickbait detector performed better with fewer false positives and false negatives, so that’s what Facebook released. It’s possible that that the unreleased version is what Gizmodo is referring to as the shelved update. Facebook tells me that unbalanced clickbait demotion of right-wing stories wasn’t why it wasn’t released, but political leaning could still be a concern.</p><p>The choice to rely on a machine learning algorithm rather than centering the fix around user reports aligns with Facebook’s recent push to reduce the potential for human bias in its curation, which itself has been problematic.</p><p>A Gizmodo report earlier this year alleged that Facebook’s human Trend curators used their editorial freedom to suppress conservative trends. Facebook denied the allegations but fired its curation team, moving to a more algorithmic system without human-written Trend descriptions. Facebook was then criticized for fake stories becoming trends, and the New York Times reports “The Trending Topics episode paralyzed Facebook’s willingness to make any serious changes to its products that might compromise the perception of its objectivity.”</p><p>If Facebook had rolled out the unreleased version of its clickbait fix, it might have relied on the subjective opinions of staffers reviewing user reports about hard-to-classify clickbait stories the way it does with more cut-and-dry hoaxes. Meanwhile, political activists or trolls could have abused the reporting feature, mass-flagging accurate stories as false if they conflicted with their views.</p><p>This tricky situation is the inevitable result of engagement-ranked social feeds becoming massively popular distribution channels for news in a politically-polarized climate where campaign objectives and ad revenue incentivize misinformation.</p><p>Facebook as well as other news distributors such as Twitter and Google have a challenge ahead. Clear hoaxes that can be disproven with facts are only part of the problem, and perhaps are easier to address. Exaggerated and heavily-spun stories that might be considered clickbait may prove tougher to fight.</p><p>Because Facebook and some other platforms reward engagement, news outlets are incentivized to frame stories as sensationally as possible. While long-running partisan outlets may be held accountable for exaggeration, newer outlets built specifically to take advantage of virality on networks like Facebook don’t face the same repercussions. They can focus on short-term traffic and ad revenue, and if people get fed up with their content, they can simply reboot with a different brand.</p><p>Simplifying user flagging of fake or exaggerated stories, appending fact-checking sites to suspicious articles, and withholding distribution from domains that haven’t proven their accuracy but prioritize monetization could be some ways to fight the avalanche of fake news. More clearly needs to be done.</p><p>But perhaps its risky to demand networks like Facebook become the truth police. That could force it to make more wide-reaching calls about what to censor that would inevitably invite blame. At least technology platforms that err on the side of ranking by engagement allow users to decide individually if what they read is false or exaggerated. Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reiterated this perspective, writing “I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.”</p><p>Right now, Facebook is damned if does allow fake news to spread because it relies on users to think for themselves, but it’s damned if it doesn’t allow fake news to spread because it makes decisions about what to censor that remove the power of choice from its users. The social network will have to choose its next moves carefully.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A lot of messaging apps have been highlighting how their services are a great way for people to directly communicate with their friends directly, in opposition to the bare-all nature of social networks like Facebook. But today Viber, the messaging app with 209 million users, is taking a different approach: it is launching Public Chats, giving users a way of using its direct messaging and voice services app to broadcast to the world at large.</p><p>Public Chats will see the introduction of live conversation streams — from celebrities, or as CEO Talmon Marco told me, other interesting people “like taxi drivers!” — that will be open for any follower to see, but not necessarily participate in. Users will only be able to jump in and talk in Public Chats if the account in question is in their contacts.</p><p>It gives Viber, which was acquired by Japan’s Rakuten earlier this year for $900 million, a little social media spin, and at the same time helps differentiate it from the rest of the crowded messaging app pack, which is led by the likes of Facebook (Messenger: 500m users; WhatsApp: 600m); but also includes a number of other very popular apps like WeChat (600m users); Line; and many more.</p><p>Public Chats is launching with a list of “global celebrities” signed up, including Perez Hilton, YouTube sensation Tyler Oakley, singer-songwriter Pixie Lott, international DJ Paul van Dyk, digital fashion innovators Next Model Management, European football channel COPA90.</p><p>Speaking while in New York for one of the two events that Viber organised to announce this news (in NYC and London), Marco tells me that it’s been optimised first for Android devices but will work on other native Viber apps, versions 5.0 or higher. You select the Public Chats bar from the main menu, then the “compass” icon to find a list of available Public Chats to follow, then you follow them.</p><p>Marco would not comment directly on whether any of Public Chats’ early adopters are getting paid to be on the service but the process at least made it sound like some of them were signing up as another way of extending their social media reach to those who opt to use Viber as their communications platform of choice.</p><p>“We spoke with a bunch of people and some offered to participate,” he said. “Generally we are looking for those who can create interesting chats — not just celebs but others like taxi drivers or bloggers, people whose conversations we feel would be interesting.” And, presumably, okay with having their conversations, or a part of them, made public for 209 million people to see.</p><p>Right now, there is no option for everyone to enable their streams to become part of the public mix but those who feel their chats are Public Chat-worthy can email publicchats@viber.com and “We’ll take a look at it,” he says. “Our intention is to open the service more after it is rolled out. As a beta product we want to have greater control at first.”</p><p>For Viber, the motivation for doing this is two-fold. It’s about using popular people to bring more engagement to Viber, and more new users to the platform. But it’s also about differentiating itself from the mass of other messaging services out there.</p><p>“This is not Twitter,” he says. “The idea is that if you know Pixie Lott, she can add her to your Public Chat and the world can see” what you say to her, and what she says back to you.</p><p>To be clear, this is not about Viber finding ways of serving ads, Marco insists. Unlike Snapchat, which is pushing ahead on its advertising services, “We are not,” he says. “This is just additional content on Viber. There will be no ads in in Public Chats.”</p><p>Interestingly, that doesn’t preclude deals that brands might cut directly with Public Chatters, similar to what happens in Instagram or Twitter with certain stars using their feeds to promote certain products. “Of course, you can put in an ad if you want for, say, Coca-Cola. But it’s your content, your chat, and we are never going to introduce things like that ourselves.”</p>",

We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation. In Newsfeed we use various signals based on community feedback to determine which posts are likely to contain inaccurate information, and reduce their distribution. In Trending we look at a variety of signals to help make sure the topics being shown are reflective of real-world events, and take additional steps to prevent false or misleading content from appearing. Despite these efforts we understand there’s so much more we need to do, and that is why it’s important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation. We’re committed to continuing to work on this issue and improve the experiences on our platform.</p><p>Facebook has previously been criticized for firing the human editors it used to employ to curate its trending news section. The replacement algorithm it switched to was quickly shown to be trivially easy to fool.</p><p>Yet the company continues to self-define as a technology platform, deliberately eschewing wider editorial responsibility for the content its algorithms distribute, in favor of applying a narrow and universal set of community standards and/or trying to find engineering solutions to filter the Newsfeed. An increasingly irresponsible position, given Facebook’s increasingly powerful position as a source of and amplifier of ‘news’ (or, as it sometimes turns out to be, propaganda clickbait).</p><p>Pew research earlier this year found that a majority of U. S. adults (62 per cent) now get news via social media. And while Facebook is not the only social media outfit in town, nor the only where fake news can spread (see also: Twitter), it is by far the dominant such platform player in the US and in many other markets.</p><p>Beyond literal fake news spread via Facebook’s click-hungry platform, the wider issue is the filter bubble its preference-fed Newsfeed algorithms use to encircle individuals as they work to spoonfeed them more clicks — and thus keep users spinning inside concentric circles of opinion, unexposed to alternative points of view.</p><p>That’s clearly very bad for empathy, diversity and for a cohesive society.</p><p>The filter bubble has been a much discussed concern — for multiple years — but the consequences of algorithmically denuding the spectrum of available opinion, whilst simultaneously cranking open the Overton window along the axis of an individual’s own particular viewpoint, are perhaps becoming increasingly apparent this year, as social divisions seem to loom larger, noisier and uglier than in recent memory — at very least as played out on social media.</p><p>We know the medium is the message. And on social media we know the message is inherently personal. So letting algorithms manage and control what is often highly emotive messaging makes it look rather like there’s a very large tech giant asleep at the wheel.</p><p>* How does Facebook respond to criticism of its Newsfeed algorithm amplifying fake news during the US election, thereby contributing negatively to misinformation campaigns and ultimately helping drive support for Donald Trump’s election?</p><p>* Does Facebook have a specific response to Buzzfeed’s investigation of websites in Macedonia being used to generate large numbers of fake news stories that were placed into the Newsfeed?</p><p>* What steps will Facebook be taking to prevent fake news being amplified and propagated on its platform in future?</p><p>* Does the company accept any responsibility for the propagation of fake news via its platform?</p><p>* Will Facebook be reversing its position and hiring human editors and journalists to prevent the trivial gaming of its news algorithms?</p><p>* Does Facebook accept that as increasing numbers of people use its platform as a main news source it has a civic duty to accept editorial responsibility for the content it is broadcasting?</p><p>* Any general comment from Facebook on Trump’s election?</p>",

    "content": "<p>While it would have been nice to tackle this issue before the election, Google and Facebook are finally taking a tiny step in order to fight back against fake news. According to multiple statements, both companies have updated their policies to ban fake news sites from using Facebook’s and Google’s advertising networks.</p><p>With the U. S. election, fake news became incredibly popular on social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, as well as news aggregating services, such as Google News and news articles in Google search results. We’re not talking about opinion articles — we’re talking about reports spreading blatantly inaccurate information.</p><p>Google first updated its policy saying that the company will try to ban sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” Websites who don’t comply with this rule will get banned from using Google AdSense.</p><p>When it comes to Facebook, the company has also updated its policy to rule out fake news sites from using Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>Google AdSense and Facebook Audience Network let content publishers display ads on their websites. Google and Facebook manage the ad inventories, content publishers get a cut for clicks or impressions.</p><p>Both companies already have strict policies for their ad networks. For instance, you can’t use Google AdSense on a porn website. Google uses a combination of algorithms and human moderation to decide whether a site is eligible to use its advertising service.</p><p>By removing a potential revenue stream, it makes the business of fake news a bit less lucrative. For instance, Buzzfeed discovered that more than 100 fake news sites were created in a tiny city in Macedonia. So it’s clear that it’s not just about influencing the election — people are taking advantage of social networks to make money using fake news.</p><p>But there will always be alternative revenue streams, so this move is not enough. Reducing the reach of these websites is the best way to prevent fake news sites from popping out. If Facebook, Twitter, Google News and other websites flagged fake news appropriately, then there would be no reason to create fake news sites in the first place.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Your hardware startup got some buzz and you beat your crowdfunding target. You’ve lived on planes to set up production, and have even been a featured speaker at some hot tech events. At last, you’re ready for the orders to start rolling in!</p><p>The good news: hardware is hot. The bad news: you’re not selling a VR visor with Facebook, Samsung, HTC or Sony backing you. More bad news: retailers don’t call; you call them. At least the big ones, those who can really drive volume. You might get dozens of enquiries from smaller ones, but serving many geographies with small volumes would be a nightmare.</p><p>So, you call the retailers. Or better yet, the sales agent you hired calls retail buyers across the country and sets up in-person meetings with each one. In those meetings, she will pitch your product, mention your thousands of pre-orders, your press coverage, and your four-and-a-half-star rating on Amazon Launchpad.</p><p>Sound daunting to navigate? It is. But to achieve market scale along the lines of GoPro and Fitbit, effectively working with big retailers is a necessary part of the process. Despite the growth of online channels, more than 90 percent of the $200 billion U. S. consumer electronics sales still comes from brick-and-mortar stores.</p><p>The hardware boom has created a glut of market-ready consumer products. This makes it extra hard to land shelf space. All too often, startups who ran a successful crowdfunding focus solely on execution of the campaign for the next 6-12 months; the campaign-generated buzz is often for naught.</p><p>Build (your brand) and they will come</p><p>Successful startups shift focus from product to sales, marketing and branding as soon as their product goes into production. This doesn’t mean assigning engineers to a sales desk! It’s about founders hiring or transitioning themselves and business-focused staff to brand-building and sales operations, and finding key sales partners.</p><p>Focus on branding and marketing first. If buyers have heard buzz about your product, they are more likely to say yes. Generate buzz through blog posts, social networks and paid marketing such as Facebook and AdWords. Build relationships with reporters and attend industry events. These efforts are not only rewarding long-term, they’ll pay off in real time through pre-orders.</p><p>Brick-and-mortar retailers often lack specialists to explain products to customers: the “unassisted sale” is a new part of your reality. You are in charge of creating demand. This is another reason to focus on building a recognizable brand; it will be critical in converting customers in-store.</p><p>Hire an expert salesperson. Sure, retail buyers love to meet startup founders — but the best person to close the deal is someone who has closed many, many retail deals and knows the ropes.</p><p>Find a sales rep or sales agency that specializes in the retailers you are targeting. Leverage your network for these leads. Investors often have a network of qualified, tenured salespeople on tap. It often takes 6-12 months for a product to hit retail shelves, so the sooner your new VP of sales can hit the phones, the better.</p><p>A number of brands have popped up on shelves since the dawn of the IoT revolution. Surprise! The winners are rock-star marketers and have built strong sales teams.</p><p>Tile, Ring and Prynt did retail right</p><p>Tile is a bluetooth tag to keep track of your belongings. It also built a community to help users find lost items. The market is crowded — TrackR, Cube and PebbleBee all compete for shelf space — but Tile managed to snag premium placement and sell millions of units at Apple, Best Buy and Target.</p><p>What was their secret? They used the momentum of their successful 2013 Selfstarter crowdfunding campaign to engage with the backer community and build awareness, even in the face of shipping delays.</p><p>They ran holiday campaigns solely based on gifting pre-orders. After shipping, they told hundreds of happy “found item” customer stories. By early 2015, Tile had hired a team of seasoned sales executives to help execute their retail strategy. Simple, explanatory packaging helped convert sales on the shelves. By the close of 2015, Tile was available at every major retailer.</p><p>Ring is a connected video doorbell that shows you via smartphone app who’s at your door. Ring hasn’t had an easy road to market; nimble competition (SkyBell, August), initial product issues and a rebranding in 2015 have all been potential hiccups.</p><p>Sure, a $28 million investment from Richard Branson doesn’t hurt — but where was the money spent? In part, on a specialized external sales network to address each retail channel, and on advertising. Ring was one of the first brands to use TV to educate the American consumer on a connected product. Investing in sales and marketing has paid off; Ring is available in all major retailers, and the company recently closed a $61.2 million Series C.</p><p>Prynt, a photo-printing smartphone case (and HAX portfolio company) has had the hardware world buzzing since running a $1.5 million Kickstarter campaign in 2015. The product launched this spring on Amazon, and will be on store shelves near you later this year. How could they be so fast?</p><p>Post-campaign, they quickly built a marketing team and secured an external VP of sales with a track record of selling connected products to retail. This focus on sales and marketing early reduced the time gap between fulfilling pre-order units and landing on retail shelves.</p><p>All I want for Christmas is your product on the shelves</p><p>Sure, these startups had airtight product/market fit (which contributed to crowdfunding and fundraising success), but reaching product/retail fit requires deliberate attention. Competition is quick to catch up, customers are fickle and there is only so much shelf space. To scale, the focus of founders must shift from product creation to demand creation, and sales. If you get this part right, we’ll see you on the shelves next Christmas!</p>",

    "content": "<p>YouTube and Google Play Movies & TV will now participate in T-Mobile’s “Binge On” program, which offers cellular subscribers the ability to watch a variety of services without those streams counting against users’ data plans. Google’s participation comes following its recent criticism of the program, which it said was unfairly throttling video services without user consent.</p><p>At the time of YouTube’s comments, T-Mobile’s Binge On program included a couple dozen major video services, including Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, ESPN, Vevo, HBO GO, and more. YouTube had opted out, as it claimed T-Mobile was lowering the video quality of those not being included, which it found problematic. T-Mobile countered by saying the program was in line with FCC regulations and could be turned off at any time by customers. It also said that any video provider could join if they met some basic technical requirements.</p><p>Consumer rights organization EFF got involved, too, saying that by making Binge On opt-out (meaning on by default), T-Mobile customers were having their video throttled without their explicit knowledge or consent.</p><p>It appears that T-Mobile and Google have now come to an agreement over the matter in question.</p><p>In an announcement posted to its Public Policy Blog, Google says that it raised its concerns with T-Mobile over the past several months, and T-Mobile has agreed to make certain improvements to the program to address those problems.</p><p>Specifically, T-Mobile has worked to improve notice and choice for users – meaning that it will better clarify to program participants what optimization means, and what the impacts of turning on or off Binge On will be.</p><p>In addition, the carrier has made it easier to turn the service on or off. Instead of having to click through a series of menus, consumers can turn it off with an SMS short code, with two clicks from the T-Mobile app, or with one click from the T-Mobile website. The change then takes place within minutes. This setting actually arrived earlier than today, notes T-Mobile. But this alone was not enough to warrant YouTube and Google Play’s participation.</p><p>Another significant change involves giving the video providers more information and choice about program participation. Before, says Google, “video services were not given a choice about whether their streams would be managed by T-Mobile if they did not join the program.” Now, video services meeting traffic-identification requirements will be able to opt-out, which means that T-Mobile will no longer modify their streams.</p><p>In addition, those who want to optimize their streams can work with T-Mobile to establish an average data limit. This will allow for an improved video experience at lower data rates, explains Google. Essentially, this allows the video provider to manage their video streams themselves, which gives them more control. Instead of using T-Mobile’s system to optimize the video, the video provider can choose to serve their own mobile-optimized video when a Binge On customer begins streaming.</p><p>T-Mobile also noted that while this option will be available to all, YouTube will be the first to take advantage of it.</p><p>YouTube and Google Play’s participation in the program begins today as a result of these changes, and comes alongside the addition of Baeble Music, Discovery GO, ESNE TV, FilmOn. TV, Fox Business, KlowdTV, and Red Bull TV. In total, there are now more than 50 video services available on Binge On, says the mobile operator, representing 70% of all video T-Mobile customers watch on phones and tablets each month.</p><p>In an announcement, T-Mobile also unveiled several data points regarding the status of the program, noting that, thanks to Binge On’s launch four months ago, its customers are now watching twice as many hours per day, in longer and more frequent viewing sessions than before. It says that more than 57 million GB (57 petabytes) have been streamed through Binge On, not counting towards users’ data plans. One unnamed video provider has seen twice the number of active viewers spike 90% and watch times nearly triple, T-Mobile also said.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Many of the polls forecasted an easy win for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the U. S. presidential election, but we now know their prediction models were flawed. While data scientists are scrambling to figure out what went wrong, a number of social media analytics firms are touting the fact that their measurements did a better job of tracking the situation out in the real world, and saw the potential for Trump’s win well in advance.</p><p>“Analysts monitoring the social media activity of both campaigns on the major social media channels saw the outcome of this election coming months ago, and kept talking about the massive silent voter base that was forming around the Republican nominee,” said Phil Ross, a social media analyst at Socialbakers.</p><p>“Social media analysts continually sounded the alarm that all of the polls were not reflecting the actual situation on the ground in the pre-election landscape,” he added.</p><p>Clinton outspent Trump on TV ads, set up more field offices, and sent staff to swing states earlier, but Trump simply better leveraged social media to both reach and grow his audience.</p><p>It seems, too, that Trump benefitted from that old adage, “any press is good press.”</p><p>While the October 7th leak of the Access Hollywood tape was reported as a low moment in the Trump campaign, it expanded his social media audience more than any other until Election Day, Socialbakers found.</p><p>During the campaign, many analytics firms noticed that a growing number of swing voters were engaging with Trump’s messages on social media.</p><p>Of course, at the time, it was unclear that social media engagement would translate into real-world votes that could put Trump in the Oval Office. After all, social media is often home to more passive participation when it comes to key matters – and routinely criticized for it.</p><p>Pundits have long dismissed social media engagement as holding little meaning beyond raising awareness at best, and not often resulting concrete change.</p><p>In a recent example, critics scoffed at the armchair activism of the Facebook Dakota pipeline check-in movement. A million people virtually checked in at Standing Rock after a viral post told them it would protect the protesters in North Dakota from police surveillance. (That wasn’t necessarily the case).</p><p>In other words, historically speaking, no one was sure that a like or re-share meant Trump was getting a vote. Especially as the polls told us otherwise.</p><p>Outside of engagement alone, other firms like SimplyMeasured saw that social media sentiment towards Donald Trump trended more positively than sentiment towards Hillary Clinton on Election Day.</p><p>Over the course of the campaign, Trump saw more mentions on social media associated with positive sentiment than his rival, as well. She closed that gap in late October and early November, but the good vibes for Trump soared once again just ahead of November 8th.</p><p>Meanwhile, though Trump had trended more negatively than Clinton up until the final debate, negative sentiment was close for the two candidates as they headed into Election Day.</p><p>A similar trend was spotted by the analytics firm 4C Insights, today cited by The WSJ, which found that Trump had more support on Facebook and Twitter from the beginning of October through November 7th. Positive sentiment for Trump was 58% to Clinton’s 48%, the firm said.</p><p>And finally, Brandwatch’s analysis also found that Trump had more Twitter mentions throughout most of the election cycle, including on Election Day. Between the start of November 8th and November 9th at 1:30am EST, Trump accumulated more than 4.9 million mentions while Clinton has just over 2.7 million.</p><p>But not all social media analytics firms believed their data could point to a Trump win. A contrarian report from CNET, for example, noted how one firm, Spredfast, believed there were too many conflicting signs on Election Day for them to make a prediction.</p><p>Still, even social media may have missed many Trump voters. During this election cycle, there were a number of silent Trump supporters, as well as those who were quietly leaning in his direction, who may have not made their views known on social media.</p><p>It appears that at least some of these supporters only took to social media once a Trump win looked possible. After Trump took swing states Florida and Ohio, positive tweeting in support of Trump spiked, Spredfast told CNET.</p><p>However, social media’s success likely means it will be given more attention in future elections. But it can’t see it all. That’s why we still need polls – preferably accurate ones next time.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The LeEco Super Bike may be the perfect analogy for the company that created it. It’s a strange amalgamation that patches together a lot of disparate ideas in a less than elegant way. It’s clearly trying really hard and will no doubt alienate some people with its over-eagerness.</p><p>That last point was the first thing a rep mentioned to me before looking at the bike earlier today. It’s a strange thing to lead with, but it’s likely already proven a pretty big source of confusion among consumers, so might as well cut that confusion off at the pass, really. It does seem a strange piece of technology to omit from “the world’s first super bike.”</p><p>At first glance, it brings to mind the bicycle that caused Pee-wee such a headache in the mid-80s. The frame of the thing is a rounded triangle, reminiscent of the Starfleet insignia turned on its side. It gives the bike an added sense of aerodynamics, I suppose, but mostly it just looks weird.</p><p>There are a trio of big buttons along the top bar; one controls the front-facing light, another snaps the back-wheel parking brake in place and a third takes shots via an optional front-facing camera, and is otherwise vestigial.</p><p>On the tail of the bike, above the rear wheel, are a pair of lasers that shoot red laser pointer-like lines out the side, creating a theoretical safety barrier to keep cars from getting too close. The lights were particularly effective in the lights of the exhibit space, but will presumably operate much better at night when they really matter.</p><p>The focal point of the Super Bike’s superness is a four-inch touchscreen that sits up front, between the handlebars, running what the company has deemed “Bike OS” (for obvious reasons) atop Android. The display was actually fairly responsive, and there’s something to be said for built-in GPS, as someone who has gotten lost on his bike several times in the city can certainly attest.</p><p>Actually using the mapping functionality while riding is another issue entirely. A four-inch screen is still pretty small when you’re trying to find the next turn while cruising down the street. Pretty clear how that could ultimately be a recipe for disaster, even with all the laser lane markers in the world deployed.</p><p>The display also can be used to do things like selecting music, played through a set of downward-facing on-board speakers.</p><p>As with most of the company’s non-smartphone/TV offerings, there’s no word yet on pricing or availability here in the States. Though the company assures us that the Super Bike will be available here in some form or other. It’s pretty clear the company mostly wanted to overwhelm its new American audience with all the different things it does in one lavish and bizarre press conference.</p><p>And really, the Super Bike is the perfect microcosm of that approach.</p>",

The FCC has officially ruled today and it turns out that Comcast will not be fined for throttling peer-to-peer network traffic, but it will have to stop discriminating against certain internet traffic until the company comes up with a compliance plan “to fully disclose its practices” to customers.</p><p>Bloomberg reports that the five-member FCC panel voted 3-2 against Comcast. Critics of Comcast’s traffic-regulating activities are calling the ruling a “bellwether case”. It’s important to note that although Comcast has been ordered to stop throttling traffic, it appears that the reasoning behind the ruling has more to do with the fact that the throttling wasn’t being disclosed to customers, not that the throttling was actually taken place. So it appears that bandwidth management can and will continue, it’ll just have to be more transparent.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Leaked emails from the Sony Pictures hack have uncovered several acquisitions made by Snapchat, as well as plans for a music feature and meetings to discuss partnerships with Twitter.</p><p>According to emails between Snapchat, Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton, and Snapchat board member Mitch Lasky, Snapchat bought a QR scanning and iBeacon startup called Scan.me for $14 million in cash, $3 million in restricted stock units and $33 million in Class B common Snapchat stock. It also acquired Vergence Labs, makers of an eyeglass video camera, for $11 million in cash and $4 million in stock.</p><p>Snapchat also apparently paid $10 million in cash and $20 million in stock and bonuses for AddLive, the startup Snapchat bought to power its real-time video chat feature but didn’t have the price for.</p><p>Other information contained in the emails includes that fact that Snapchat has recently been working on a music feature, and CEO Evan Spiegel has grand aspirations to promote artists through his app and capitalize on their success. Snapchat negotiated with Vevo for a feature that sounds like it would bring music video viewing inside Snapchat in August, but hit a snag over the revenue sharing on advertising. Valleywag reported earlier today that emails indicate the acquisition deal from Facebook that Snapchat turned down was more than $3 billion.</p><p>Snapchat’s Steve Hwang emailed Lasky and Lynton telling them the acquisition of Scan.me is “Super secret as usual (won’t be announced publicly),” that the company “specializes in QR scanning/creation as well as iBeacon tech,” and that “7 engineers from Utah, who will be moving out in the coming weeks.”</p><p>As Business Insider reports, Snapchat paid “$15,000,000 in cash that will be paid to Buyer in two separate payments…” “$11,000,000 in cash” and “an amount equal to $4,000,000 in cash that will be…subject to monthly vesting over 24 months based on the continued employment of the stockholders.”</p><p>The company, co-founded by UCLA grad student Erick Miller in 2011, saw coverage in the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal before being secretly bought out.</p><p>Vergence Labs’ core product is Epiphany Eyewear — glasses with a built-in video camera that sold at $299 for the 8 gig storage model, $399 for 16 gigs, and $499 for 32 gigs. Wearers could tap a button on the frame of the glasses to record a video, then upload it to their computers later so they could cut screenshots if they wanted photos. All three models are now sold out.</p><p>As far back as October 2013, Lynton was talking to talent agency William Morris Endeavors’ CEO Ari Emanual about the potential to work with Snapchat.</p><p>The company has already prominently featured artists such as Goldroom, Vance Joy and Strange Talk in its promo videos, helping to grow their fan bases and become darlings of the teen market. In some cases, after users watch the videos, they’ve been able to tap through to visit the iTunes store and buy the music from the videos.</p><p>Spiegel met with Sony Music Entertainment’s President of Global Digital Business & US Sales in June and told him he was interested in bringing music to Snapchat. Kooker writes that Spiegel “thinks every music service in the market is shit and he wants to be a curator.” Snapchat’s CEO expressed interest in starting a record label and promoting the artists through Snapchat.</p><p>Kooker said Spiegel wants to “participate in the upside he will create by promoting [artists] on the platform, but later “backed off a bit from being a record label.” Both Kooker and Lynton believe Snapchat should become a music promotion platform.</p><p>A few months later in August, the music feature seems to have been taking shape. Manny Adler, son of record producer and Roxy Theater owner Lou Adler, began visiting Snapchat “to discuss music and develop ways of integrating music into Snapchat.”</p><p>In November, there was talk of Spiegel meeting with Sony imprint Epic Records’ bigshot CEO L. A. Reid.</p><p>Later in August, Snapchat met with Vevo president Rio Caraeff to discuss a potential partnership for a “Vevo video integration” that likely would let Snapchat users watch music videos alongside Stories from fellow users. This set of negotiations fell through because Spiegel demanded “40% of gross which is just not workable for us” wrote Caraeff. That doesn’t mean it won’t happen, though. Negotiations with Vevo or another music video provider could have progressed since then.</p><p>Twitter CEO Dick Costolo met with Spiegel in January 2014 to discuss “a couple big ideas we have about working with SnapChat.” Twitter was also lending Snapchat some engineering help to Snapchat CTO Bobby Murphy, as Costolo wrote in an email to Lynton that “I’ve also asked my CTO to be as helpful as possible to Bobby about scaling the platform.”</p><p>We haven’t seen any fruits of these “big ideas” linking Twitter and Snapchat, but the two companies could surely help each other. Twitter saves everything publicly and forever, while Snapchat’s content is more frequently private and always ephemeral.</p><p>A music integration and partnership with Twitter both mesh with Snapchat’s plan to become a platform for third-party services, as reported by The Information earlier this year. Snapchat recently made its first move in this direction with the launch of Snapcash, a peer-to-peer payments feature powered by Square.</p><p>At one point, Snapchat board member Mitch Lasky sent Lynton research from a hedge fund manager explaining how Asian messaging apps are becoming successful platforms for other services like shopping or taxi hailing, and how Snapchat has a big opportunity to do the same in the States.</p><p>Overall, the emails show that Snapchat has been able to make big moves like acquisitions and negotiating big-wig partnerships in secret despite the press scrutiny. With the talent and tech from the buyouts and its platform aspirations, Snapchat could soon become much more than a photo and video-sharing service.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Back in the day, we reported that messaging app Snapchat* was raising over $100 million in a round led by Kleiner Perkins. And then the WSJ reported that it was $20 million, which left us wondering why a growth round would be so small in terms of total principle. Well, it turns out it’s not.</p><p>Snapchat has raised a much bigger amount: Nearly $500 million in aggregate, according to an SEC filing that it slipped out as the working day for New Years Eve was drawing to a close. The filing notes that 23 investors took part, although it’s not clear from the SEC document who led the round.</p><p>Here is what happened, according to our sources: Snapchat originally set out to raise $40 million, but demand for the round skyrocketed, and it decided to shoot for an ambitious $900 million instead. When that didn’t work out, it dialled it back to $500 million. Rumor has it that Kleiner is leading this latest round, with GIC, Yahoo and maybe wildcards August Capital participating. Portions of that, such as the Yahoo part of the fundraise, closed some time ago. The SEC filing notes that the date of first sale was in April 2014.</p><p>We’ve also heard that the current post money valuation is $20 billion, although others have disputed this and said it’s closer to $10 billion.</p><p>The cash is much-needed. One source said that Snapchat has an over $30 million-per-year burn rate, and pays half of that to Google Apps Engine to host all its photos, though this number seems low to us. Another noted that at one point the company was paying $3 million each month in legal fees alone. Snapchat’s had its share of lawsuits.</p><p>Alibaba was the original lead on that round as Re/Code (nee AllThingsD) reported. According to a source, the Alibaba position was then punted to Yahoo, which put in $20 million of its own cash on hand post the Alibaba IPO. We’ve also heard that Yahoo has actually put in more than this but have been unable to corroborate that beyond the $20 million close.</p><p>The cause of the numerical ups and downs of Snapchat’s fundraising is the company’s unique spin on financing, which works on a “rolling” basis, from how one source describes it.</p><p>Snapchat is interesting in that they break the conventions of traditional fundraising, one source tells us. Traditionally an entrepreneur will set out to raise a round for a specified amount of money, and then you get interested investors on the same page based on an agreed valuation and then you close it. Spiegel does this somewhat differently. “He goes after individual investors at different valuations. It’s a rolling investment and a rolling close. In theory you could say he’s already done 40 rounds.” (40 is likely figurative rather than literal.)</p><p>What this means is that, if it’s true, then yes, Snapchat may have raised nearly $500 million in the last six months. Of that $500 million, it may be that only 75% of it is closed, and with portions at different valuations, some getting in pre-$10-billion, like Yahoo, and some above it and closer to $20 billion.</p><p>The logic for the high valuation is interesting, too, and points to some of the big hopes Snapchat and its investors have for the app. The last reported number of active monthly users of the ephemeral message app was 100 million back in August 2014, but things are moving fast. From what we understand the MAU number is now approaching 200 million users. The company in May 2014 reported 700 million photos sent per day on the app, with 500 million Snapchat Stories.</p><p>Among the company’s revenue-generating services are sponsored Our Stories, which launched in November. There have also been interesting appearances from companies like Amazon using the platform to send disappearing deals to users, and while Snapchat and Amazon may be talking, the e-commerce giant is not among the list of investors at the moment, says a source.</p><p>*Disclosure: Alexia’s SO’s VC firm is an investor in Snapchat.</p>",

We want to make sure we prioritize delivering the best possible experience to the platforms our users are asking for, which is why we’ve decided to focus our efforts in other areas while supporting key functionality on Skype for TV for as long as possible.</p><p>Skype became available for smart TVs back in 2010. The app was pre-loaded on some sets — such as those from Samsung and LG — and available to download on many others, including models from Sony, Panasonic and Sharp.</p><p>As someone who had used it in the past, I found that the app didn’t quite deliver on its promise — which sounds great in theory. The service was somewhat unreliable and tricky to set up, whereas picking up a phone or tablet and launching an app is second nature to people these days. Plus, there are many more video calling options, including nearly every popular messaging app and Apple’s own FaceTime service.</p><p>Skype’s smart TV app will no longer receive updates after June 1, but those who have already downloaded it can continue to use it. There’s no confirmed date for when the app will cease to work, but it is living on borrowed time.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Imagine a world where you buy mobile phone, data, voice and television services from a single provider. A world where you don’t worry about running out of wireless minutes, exceeding text message limits or running up roaming charges. A world where you talk, text and stream video on an iPad, TV, laptop or mobile phone, seamlessly using the same user interface and applications across wireless networks, fiber optics and Wi-Fi.</p><p>A pipe dream? Not in Europe, where the long-awaited convergence of wireless and wireline telecommunications services is already underway. Major combinations in the past two years include wireless giant Vodafone’s $10 billion purchase of Spanish cable operator Ono, and the $1.4 billion purchase of Belgian mobile carrier BASE by Liberty Global, Europe’s largest cable company.</p><p>And now convergence is crossing the Atlantic — with big implications for U. S. customers and carriers. Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, has signaled it will add wireless to its menu of fixed-line video, data and voice services, making it the first to offer the complete convergence experience. This move is all but certain to send other carriers scrambling across the wireless-wireline divide.</p><p>U. S. consumers who have shown lukewarm interest in bundled telecommunications services don’t know it yet, but they’re going to love convergence. Comcast’s pilot testing next year will give many U.S. customers their first glimpse at truly comprehensive, seamless services at a reasonable price. As Steve Jobs might have said — when they get it, they’ll realize they always wanted it.</p><p>Customer benefits start with savings. The average price of bundled voice, data, video and mobile service runs about 10 to 12 percent below the total cost of purchasing all four separately, based on A. T. Kearney analysis of prevailing plan prices in France and Spain.</p><p>Greater benefits will materialize in the long run as convergence triggers innovation. A provider offering all four services has a powerful incentive to drive usage by creating seamless experiences that encourage customers to stay connected. And a simplified pricing and billing system could replace today’s bewildering array of charges with a single price for services across all devices.</p><p>Convergence also makes business sense for the maturing telecommunications sector. Both wireless and wireline carriers have seen subscriber growth plateau. At wireless companies, average revenue per customer is falling and profit margins are under pressure. Adding new services to the mix would open a new revenue channel. At the same time, convergence can expand profit margins through cost synergies and enhanced customer loyalty. In recent wireless-fixed mergers in Europe such as Vodafone/Ono and Everything Everywhere/BT, companies projected consolidation synergies in the range of 8 to 10 percent of wireless costs in their investor presentations.</p><p>European experience also demonstrates that customers who buy more than one service from a carrier tend to stick around longer. According to Ovum, churn reduction is the most common objective of convergence; Ovum research found a 50 percent reduction in churn among customers with multiple services at Belgacom and KPN, the leading telecom carriers in Belgium and Netherlands, respectively.</p><p>Convergence won’t reach the entire U. S. all at once. Unlike European countries, where wireline carriers offer nationwide service, fixed-line companies in the U.S. have fragmented regional footprints. The largest, AT&T, covers less than 40 percent of the country, according to the FCC. As a result, convergence is likely to progress on a city-by-city basis until the whole country is covered.</p><p>Comcast will provide both a catalyst and an initial model for convergence in the U. S. The cable giant is moving into wireless as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) under an agreement that allows it to resell service on Verizon’s network. Others likely will start out as MVNOs, too. But as we’ve seen in Europe, the end game appears to be outright mergers of wireline and wireless companies seeking the full synergies and other benefits of convergence.</p><p>Cable companies are well-positioned to take the lead in consolidation, thanks to their dominance of wireline markets around the country. Few localities have more than one cable television company, but most have several wireless carriers. This means cable companies can pick and choose among potential merger partners, while wireless carriers will have only one option in each market.</p><p>Convergence will drive structural change in the telecommunications industry, as consolidation reshapes the competitive landscape and carriers confront the technological and operational challenges of combining wireless and wireline services.</p><p>An initial hurdle is consumer indifference. A 2015 consumer study by GSMA found just 5 percent of U. S. customers with access to bundled services buy more than one from a single provider, even though 36 percent purchase the full suite of mobile, video, voice and data services. That’s where the discount off à la carte pricing comes in. Customers attracted by cost savings will quickly grasp the other benefits of bundling. As word spreads, adoption rates could rise to the 30 percent to 40 percent range, as seen in countries such as Portugal with mature converged offerings.</p><p>Customers who love the seamless experience of converged wireless and wireline services will expect that experience to extend beyond the screen. For example, they’ll want a single customer service representative to handle all their service needs. This poses a challenge to carriers with different service organizations for different services, MVNO carriers reselling wireless service on another company’s network and companies working to integrate newly acquired operations.</p><p>Convergence also will spark an evolutionary change in telecommunications networks. Combined wireless-wireline service requires a multi-layered network architecture spa</p>",

    "content": "<p>Apple and Microsoft both held big hardware events this week, unveiling a few new devices like the new MacBook Pro and the Surface Studio. Twitter announced it is shutting down Vine and laying off 9% of the company. Oh, and AT&T is acquiring Time Warner for a whole lot of money. These are the top stories of the week.</p><p>1. Tim Cook took the stage at an Apple MacBook event at Apple HQ in Cupertino to announce the new MacBook Pro. Most notably, in the premiere models, Apple has done away with the Mac’s row of function keys and replaced it with a mini Retina display called the Touch Bar. Touch Bar lets you interact directly with whatever software you are using, adjusting its touch functionality to the task at hand. Apple seems to have pulled the 11-inch MacBook Air from all of its online stores, too. Here’s the full recap and full coverage of the MacBook event.</p><p>2. Apple wasn’t the only company to show off new devices this week. Microsoft also held a hardware event where it announced the Windows 10 Creator’s update, a new Surface Book and the new all-in-one $2,999 PC, the Surface Studio.</p><p>3. Are carriers still worried about being dumb pipes? After days of speculation, it was confirmed that AT&T is acquiring Time Warner for $85.4 billion in a mix of cash and shares. The deal will bring the carrier a huge trove of content producing properties, including HBO, CNN, and the Warner Bros. studio that will give it a leg up in its own video and content business.</p><p>4. It’s earnings season again – and here are this week’s highlights: In a surprising miss, Amazon disappointed investors after posting Q3 earnings and stock fell 6% in after hours trading. Twitter’s sales team took a big hit in its earnings report and may cut up to 9% of its staff, or around 300 people. Apple reported earnings ahead of its huge holiday retail season that were directly in line with Wall Street’s expectations.</p><p>5. Remember the DDoS attack last week that took out Twitter, Amazon, Shopify and other sites? Dyn said last week it identified “10s of millions” of unique IP addresses involved in the massive botnet attack. This week, Chinese company Hangzhou Xiongmai recalled web cameras that made up a good portion of the devices involved in the breach.</p><p>6. Nothing loops forever. Twitter announced that it’s shutting down Vine, its standalone short-form video app. Cue the Vine star heartbreak.</p><p>7. Maybe not everyone is convinced they need a smartwatch. A new IDC report showed that smartwatch shipments experienced “significant” declines in the third quarter, as total shipments were down 51.6 percent from the same time last year. Just 2.7 million units were shipped in Q3 2016 versus 5.6 million in Q3 2015. These numbers indicate that smartwatches may be having a hard time finding traction among the majority of consumers.</p><p>8. Another city, another Airbnb lawsuit. Airbnb sued the city of New York, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Mayor Bill de Blasio over legislation that would make it illegal to advertise listings that can’t legally be rented out for less than 30 days. The bill was passed in June and signed into law by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo last week. Airbnb is claiming the law is a violation of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for content posted by users.</p><p>9. The FCC voted to adopt new privacy rules that severely restrict what data ISPs can collect from you without your consent. The Association of National Advertisers called the rules “unprecedented, misguided and extremely harmful.” If that isn’t a strong endorsement, I don’t know what is.</p><p>10. Amazon continued its efforts to crack down on fake reviews across its site with new lawsuits aimed at two U. S. sellers and one from the E.U. The suits claim to have evidence of customer review abuse – meaning the defendants created fake reviews for their products which then influenced customer buying decisions.</p><p>11. Sometimes, “pivot” isn’t a strong enough word. One example is the story of the startup Famous, a company that had to fire 30 of 34 employees to survive, but is now somehow thriving again. Steve Newcomb’s $30 million-funded open source JavaScript startup was going down in flames, with a spiraling burn rate and no business model. Laying off 90 percent of the company and forging an entirely different direction was the only option.</p>",

In addition, the call log will show which calls were made via video by annotating them with the camera icon, instead of the telephone icon.</p><p>However, there isn’t yet a way to call other WhatsApp users who don’t also have video calling support. If you try to, WhatsApp defaults to a voice call.</p><p>Android isn’t the only platform where video calling has been switched on. Last week, some users on the WhatsApp beta for Windows Phone were also surprised to find that the feature was now functional. And in this case, it didn’t require an app update – indicating a server-side change could enable it.</p><p>In the Windows Phone beta, video calls worked the same as on Android. When you tapped the call button, you could pick between voice and video. During calls, you can also mute the call or switch cameras, early adopters noted.</p><p>Before you get too excited, let’s remember that this is not the first time Android users were randomly able to use video calling. A beta build released in May had turned this option on then, but WhatsApp later removed it.</p><p>That being said, WhatsApp in the past has trialled big updates to its apps in a similar fashion. For example, it was a couple of months before voice calling went from testing on Android to being publicly available on the platform, and then another month before it went live on iOS.</p><p>What is interesting is that it’s taken this long to bring the feature to WhatsApp’s 1 billion users, given the messaging service now has access to resources and the technical know-how from parent company Facebook, which switched on free, VOIP video calls in April 2015.</p><p>In any event, the timing is ripe for a video calling launch on WhatsApp, assuming it wants to remain competitive. Failing to get this feature out the door could leave room for newcomer Google Duo to gain traction with smartphone users, as video calling grows in popularity.</p><p>Unlike Apple’s FaceTime, Duo works across both iOS and Android, but doesn’t offer much in terms of frills, like group calling or video effects. Google also weirdly split up text and video into separate apps, Duo and Allo, instead of combining them into a single, more functional app.</p><p>Reached for comment, WhatsApp declined to offer insights into its plans for video calling, saying only that “we do not comment on future product plans or beta releases of WhatsApp.”</p><p>Update: some are seeing on iOS –</p>",

The long lines from Friday, along with high selling prices on eBay that are hitting 20x the original Spectacles spelling price, suggest a lot of people could be looking to pick them up – but the somewhat remote location might make for a very different scene.</p><p>If you’re curious about what it’s like to use Spectacles feel free to check out the first impressions of TC’s Editor-in-Chief and resident hypebeat Matthew Panzarino, but everyday users seem to love the things, too, so if you don’t mind a lineup (plus beautiful California coastal highway views) and you’re in the area, there’s probably no reason not to go down and get in line.</p><p>The second location indicates that contrary to prevailing theories, Snapchat won’t be making Snapbots available first at big urban centers like SF and New York. Instead, the company seems to want to provoke some interesting road trips with its rollout strategy – something which may, in part, be driven by Spectacle inventory scarcity, but which also finds with its brand advertising, wherein beautiful millennial take beautiful road trips while enjoying the social app.</p><p>The Snapbot is at The Big Sur Bakery according to people on Twitter, so you can also carbo load while you’re picking up some Specs.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Some have criticised Google for falling behind when it comes to social networking and new communications services, but the company is now working hard to catch up. Today, the company announced a new video calling app called Duo — a high-definition app for Android and iOS devices.</p><p>Duo was unveiled on the heels of Allo, Google’s new smart messaging app. Why the decision to launch two separate apps? A couple of reasons, it seems. The first is to keep the experiences simple and lightweight; and the second: to do something a little different from the rest of the pack. Facebook, for example, has supercharged Messenger with smart bots, as well as voice and video calling and more on top of its basic text messaging service.</p><p>While Allo is focused on interacting with Google’s assistant bot and with potentially many friends and may be more comparable to something like Messenger, Duo’s comparison is something more like Apple’s FaceTime: you use it for one-on-one conversations.</p><p>With the app only due to go live later this year — likely this summer, similar to Allo — among the details that Google is making public today is a preview feature, which gives users a real-time image of the person calling you before the call is actually connected. Google calls this Knock Knock.</p><p>The other thing that Duo is touting is the engineering that has gone into making the video in the app work. Google says it will work the same whether your network is superfast or patchy. This in itself, if it really bears out, would be amazing for anyone who has cursed his or her way through a bad Hangout or Skype call.</p><p>Duo was built by the same team that created WebRTC and it uses WebRTC, engineering director Erik Kay said today on stage at I/O. It was built using a new programming protocol, Quic, which Google unveiled last year as a route to speeding up data-heavy applications that travel over the web.</p><p>While Google tells me that Hangouts will continue to exist as its own mobile app even with the launch of Duo and Allo, the fact that Hangouts comes with a history — some good, some bad — may also be why Google opted for a completely different branding and experience for Duo.</p><p>As with Allo, Duo will let you connect with users in your phone book, offering us one more way to bypass our mobile carriers when making calls. It’s unclear whether it will interoperate with other video services.</p><p>While Allo was uncovered months before now, it looks like Google has managed to keep Duo under wraps, with the only leak about an upcoming video app in recent times being of a Periscope-like competitor.</p>",

Until recently politics, warfare, commerce, and education has mostly been offline. That will change drastically in the next ten years.</p><p>But isn’t the world already digital? Most of it is but the places that it isn’t – parts of rural America, the third world, huge swathes of Asia and India – are getting more bandwidth than ever. Our devices are constantly online and listening and our homes are full of things that glow, beep, and buzz.</p><p>Look at the news. The FBI is using Malware “like a grenade.” Legal pot sellers are using Bitcoin to skirt banking regulations. The coffee shop has been replaced by the Facebook thread. The two biggest crises of this US election are based on the infallibility of network memory. In one corner Clinton was constantly attacked for an email server and on the other side Trump was attacked for things he said in passing that spread like kudzu through the Internet. Ultimately both sides used the Internet to magnify their message.</p><p>Social media is just the beginning. We are already offloading most of our petty tasks to computers and as they get smarter we’ll offload even more.</p><p>A plugged-in fried of mine expects commercial quantum computing to come online in five years. This means we’ll have more computing power available to us (and our cloud services) than ever. Our devices are constantly listening and at the ready and self-driving cars are coming faster than we expected. While many technologies, including blockchain, will take decades to mature we can expect parts of these technologies to embed themselves in our lives in the next few years.</p><p>We must react to these changes quickly or be quickly left behind. The digital-first government services cropping up in Estonia and the pro-startup movement in Poland are perfect examples of countries doing it mostly right. The bad news is that legislators are bailing water out of a sinking boat and not plugging existing holes. Banking regulation is woefully behind the times as is the slow crawl of drug legalization. There are no clear ways forward to catching and trying international cybercriminals and in an era when the next military attack could come from the Internet that’s pretty scary. 3D printing is a great hobby but it quickly get derailed by talk of 3D printed guns and drone bombs. We are at once ignorant of the extent and danger of our digital world and deathly afraid of it.</p><p>The next ten years will require us all to understand the vagaries of email servers, how to react when the credit card system is shut down by Anonymous, and how to avoid getting hit by ransomware. We’ll be plugging in more and more often and the world may look like an episode of Black Mirror if we don’t start actively separating the online and offline by putting our toys away and looking each other in the eye. And, in the end, the pace of change will keep rising, leaving the angry, the afraid, and the uneducated behind. I’d wager it’s our collective mission to make sure that doesn’t happen and, if it does, that the damage is limited and the lessons learned are the good ones.</p>",

    "content": "<p>For startup CEOs, tough economic periods are like stressful stretches in a marriage: They test your mettle while making ugly truths impossible to hide. And these days, amid industry-wide belt-tightening, “down rounds” and a still-moribund (though hopefully improving) IPO market, many venture-backed CEOs are baring it all — or should be — to their board members.</p><p>But just how should you, exactly, communicate with your investors when navigating a rough patch? I’m not talking about minor problems, like losing an employee or hitting 90 percent of your revenue plan. I’m talking about big issues, or even life-threatening situations: You’re down to six months’ worth of cash and verging on crisis.</p><p>In my experiences as a VC, I come down hard on the side of openness and transparency. Admittedly, being transparent is easy for me and tougher on my CEOs. After all, I’m not the one girding up for a difficult meeting that could make me look bad. But, as I’ve noted, it’s easier to get divorced than rid yourself of a VC investor, who should be your steadfast, long-term partner on this journey. Transparency with your investors builds trust, which facilitates sharing good advice and maximizing options. Lack of trust shuts down all those avenues. Openness with your VCs is not only the “right” strategy, it’s the smartest one. Here is some tactical advice.</p><p>First, I believe all CEOs need to be conscious of managing to reality, and not perception. You might be tempted to hide bad news from your board initially, or at least minimize it; if you’ve been media-trained, you know you’re supposed to stay positive and publicly “on message.”</p><p>That’s fine, except your investors are not “the public,” or reporters. They’re insiders, and they also often have a lot of experience about how to navigate tricky business situations. They also respect CEOs who admit mistakes, don’t sugar-coat problems and are willing to take calculated risks to improve their businesses. In other words, they respect leaders who are not worried about how big and possibly controversial business moves will be perceived by outsiders.</p><p>I work with one software CEO who I’d call a two-time offender of doing the right thing in this regard. Twice in our relationship he’s made proactive, difficult decisions that caused short-term pain for his company and could have led to bad press. But the moves resulted in long-term value for him and investors.</p><p>His first decision, made several years ago, was executing a substantial pivot away from an initial business model as an advertising network. Despite the business generating about $20 million of revenue, he concluded it was not creating durable value, so he shut down that business and took the company’s revenue to zero. He then spent the next few years re-building his product and selling it via a SaaS (software-as-a-service) model. Fast-forward to today, and he now has a rapidly growing SaaS business that is far bigger (and much more valuable) that his initial ad network.  Shutting down the initial business and re-starting from scratch took guts, but it was the right long-term decision.</p><p>Tough decision No. 2 happened a couple of years later when this CEO essentially fired one-third of his SaaS customers because he wanted to migrate to larger enterprise accounts. His existing base of smaller customers simply wasn’t profitable. This stalled the company’s revenue for a year as it back-filled its sales pipeline with larger deals, but the company emerged with a much more stable (and profitable!) customer base.</p><p>This CEO also exemplified another piece of advice I give my CEOs: In bad times, you should own the problem, and then over-communicate when it comes to informing your board about it and exploring solutions.</p><p>In other words, don’t pass the buck. CEOs who don’t own their problems waste energy blaming other people — energy that should be funneled toward fixing their companies.</p><p>Once you’ve taken ownership, waste no time in bringing your board members into the conversation, and hold nothing back. At those early meetings held to discuss the problem, lay out the issues clearly, demonstrate you’ve studied them from all sides and present your straw-man recommendation. I call this a “straw man” because it may or may not be your ultimate move, but it’s your best idea right now. Stay open to changing your mind after talking with your board members; that’s the benefit such conversations can offer. You should speak to mentors and other CEOs you trust, as well.</p><p>Depending on the severity of the issue, you may also want to set up weekly calls to keep your board abreast of the situation and solicit ongoing feedback. In one recent situation with a portfolio company, we had a standing call every week for roughly six months as the executives worked through a very tricky financing situation. This consistency was very helpful to both the CEO and the board as it kept everyone in sync, built trust and allowed us to successfully navigate the situation.</p><p>The next logical step is getting tactical. My advice for companies in trouble is to focus maniacally on one or two key business metrics that directly correlate to the health of the company. This might be driving website traffic, reducing customer churn, slashing expenses or simply getting to break-even by any means necessary. In this situation, having fun and cultivating a quirky company culture are no longer high priorities.</p><p>Fold up the ping pong tables and turn off the craft beer on tap — you’ve got serious work to do. You’ll be surprised at the clarity this new focus brings. In addition, your go-forward plan needs tactical milestones to prove it’s working. Report on those milestones regularly to your board. Solicit their advice, and come to meetings prepared with ideas if things aren’t working as planned.</p><p>My portfolio company HotelTonight was recently profiled in the press for successfully transitioning from a high-burn business into a fast-growing, profitable company. One of the ke</p>",

(AOL owns TechCrunch, and I’m told there will be a TechCrunch channel in Tango.)</p><p>When asked how the relationship between users and brands will be different on Tango compared with other social media, Setton told me: “Everybody’s noticed that Facebook’s organic reach has declined. Basically, there are so many pages that it’s difficult to surface out of the noise. So I think that it’s interesting to be present on platforms that already have hundreds of millions of members, but to be early to show yourself to that audience.”</p><p>To be clear, Tango will be making money from these channels indirectly, so it continues to run ads in the feed. Plus, Setton argued that the channels will drive engagement and downloads for Tango’s partners, which in turn will encourage them to pay for Tango ads.</p><p>Tango, by the way, announced a $280 million round led by China’s Alibaba earlier this year. The company said at the time that it has 200 million registered users, with 70 million active each month.</p>",

(Although it subsequently expanded that cap to 20,000.)</p><p>It’s now taken the stabilizer wheels off its chatbot developer initiative, launching a new Messaging API at a conference in Japan which it’s touting as simper than the prior bot API.</p><p>The mobile messaging giant, which competes with the likes of WhatsApp and WeChat and has 218 million monthly active users, is most popular in Asia, with two-thirds of Line users in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia.</p><p>The new Line Messaging API introduces three new message types aiming to structure and simplify bot development:</p><p>* A new confirm type that allows for a simple selection between two choices such as a yes or no response</p><p>* A button type that combines pictures, text and other action buttons</p><p>carousel type which allows the same data from a button type message to be placed in a horizontally scrolling format so that multiple content can be displayed</p><p>“These new message types sent by chatbots allow companies to realise a smoother Line-based contact point with users for their services and content,” it said in a press release. “Line plans to introduce even more message types in the future.”</p><p>The new Line Messaging API also supports chatbots being used in group chats with multiple users.</p><p>Line also announced a chatbot competition — with a deadline of January 2017 for applications and winners to be named next February.</p><p>It’s not the only messaging platform using cash to incentivize developers to build bots: Telegram announced a $1M bot giveaway back in April, with a focus on utility.</p><p>Line said its aim is to reward chatbot developers whose creations provide “new value to its user experience”. The competition will pay out a maximum of 10 million yen (around $98,000) to the overall winner, with other rewards intended for additional categories.</p><p>Also today, Line announced it has also been working on developing some chatbots itself internally, and with external partners, flagging up two for the Japanese market: a train times bot, called Navitime, and a music search bot that hooks into its music streaming service, Line Music.</p><p>It also announced an official SDK, with support for five languages (Java, Go, Ruby, PHP and Perl 5) — claiming this makes it “easier than ever for developers to create chatbots”.</p><p>Another announcement was Line Notify: aka an API-based service that enables external web services and applications to send notifications to users as Line account messages. So basically another line in (pun intended) for external services to reach users of the platform without users needing to actually leave.</p><p>“Starting today, this service is connected with the web-task automation tool IFTTT, which means that users can receive weather information, e-mails including specified keywords or other notification messages from various services without anyone performing any additional coding,” it noted of Line Notify.</p>",

However, key to these consumer experiences are partnerships the company has with major players in the travel industry.</p><p>“Our bespoke end-to-end platforms that we develop specifically for travel agents, hotels, airlines and venues, have enabled us to ink deals with some of the world’s largest travel industry organisations this year including Travelport, 15below and Trekksoft,” says the Musement CEO.</p><p>Meanwhile, the company plans to use the new capital to invest further in its technology, and for growth — it currently operates in 450 cities across 55 countries in 7 languages. This will include additional offices to complement its HQ in Milan and recently opened Spanish office in Barcelona.</p><p>Adds Petazzi: “Our goal was also to make a seamless booking experience across all verticals, helping consumers to discover things that are relevant to them, whether at home or travelling. Until now, this integrated experience had never been achieved and our new funding round will assist us in executing this vision even further”.</p>",

Backers include Sussex Place Ventures, SaatchInvest, Gecad, and Playfair Capital. It brings total funding for Gluru to $3.5 million.</p><p>Founded two years ago by Tim Porter, who was an early employee at Shazam and also worked at Google and Apple, the company is building AI technology to automatically turn the tsunami of communications data we amass into actionable tasks, thereby significantly increasing our productivity.</p><p>Available for web, Android and an iOS version in beta, Gluru’s first product is a smart to-do list app that claims to use a multi-patented and unique approach to natural language processing, deep learning, and ontology, in order to sync with your various “conversational data sources” — initially Gmail and Google Calendar — to identify daily tasks and suggest relevant actions.</p><p>“We start by simplifying conversations into tasks,” says Porter. “Tasks frame not only our actions and goals, but also those of services, devices, and machines we use every day. We found that if artificial intelligence could identify and understand these building blocks to our daily lives, then it is possible to predict the complementary action (and in the near future answers)”.</p><p>Naturally, the smart to-do list learns from how you interact with it (it wouldn’t be very smart otherwise) and claims to automate the most repetitive tasks and flag up the ones that need your attention. The latter might include an email that requires an urgent reply or a phone call that needs scheduling.</p><p>The long term vision is that once you’ve connected Gluru to your various data sources the startup’s natural language processing and machine learning handles the rest. “Currently, Gluru supports Gmail and Google Calendar. A host of sources are coming soon, such as Outlook, Slack, Alexa, Google Drive, Dropbox and Salesforce, and Gluru can live inside all of these ecosystems, powering productivity,” adds Porter.</p><p>Alex Dunsdon, equity partner at SaatchInvest, says in a statement: “We love groundbreaking enterprise AI that provides practical applications right now, as Gluru is doing – not some distant R&D pipe dream. Tim and the Gluru team have some of the best AI talent in the world, disrupting the productivity space today, and we’re excited about where they can take this”.</p>",

Given he’s a man of many conflicting words it’s near impossible to know which of his pledges and pronouncements he will keep or act upon, likely until his administration is up and running and showing its true colors.</p><p>Yet uncertainty can itself be a motivator — and the risk of an authoritarian leader as commander-in-chief of the US’ government’s mass surveillance apparatus has caused many to sound alarm bells already.</p><p>Trump has previously said he supports legislation allowing the NSA to hold bulk metadata, albeit with a court authorizing access — telling The Daily Signal back in May 2015 that a new oversight court should be created which is “available any time on any day… to issue individual rulings on when this metadata can be accessed.”</p><p>He has also previously talked about giving the NSA “as much leeway as possible” to use surveillance to fight terrorism. Yet in the same interview he emphasized the need to balance Constitutional protections with national security considerations, telling Breibart in October 2015 that “Congress should continue to be the arbiter of that balance”.</p><p>Wherever Trump’s own line lies, one thing is clear: with Republicans set to control both houses of Congress, the new president and his party will have sweeping power to shape US surveillance powers as they see fit.</p><p>Back in 2013, speaking to documentary maker Laura Poitras, Edward Snowden warned of the US’ mass surveillance infrastructure enabling what he dubbed “turnkey tyranny”.</p><p>After the election result this week Snowden pointedly retweeted this warning…</p><p>Covering fears over how Trump will approach encryption and surveillance policy, Reuters quotes Hank Thomas, COO of cyber security-focused investment fund Strategic Cyber Ventures, arguing that Trump is “probably going to mandate back doors”.</p><p>Probably is not definitely, because again there’s no way to be sure right now, but even the existence of a perceived risk is clearly enough for some — Swiss-based encrypted email provider ProtonMail tells TechCrunch it saw an immediate 80 per cent increase in the number of people signing up for its service the day after the US election.</p><p>And later blogged that signups had doubled.</p><p>ProtonMail does not track the location of signs ups, but co-founder Andy Yen is sure of the trigger. “This could only be caused by the election,” he says. “I think a lot of Americans woke up and realised that starting next year, Trump controls the NSA.”</p><p>In his blog discussing the implications of Trump’s election for privacy Yen also writes: “Today, we are seeing an influx of liberal users, but ProtonMail has also long been popular with the political right, who were truly worried about big government spying, and the Obama administration having access to their communications. Now the tables have turned.”</p><p>Another startup seeing uplift in the wake of a Trump election is Europe-based messaging app Telegram, which has an end-to-end encrypted messaging ‘secret chats’ feature — and has frequently been called out as a blocker to state security agencies seeking to access comms. It also says it saw a bump in global signups the day after the US election. Although no significant spike from the US itself, according to co-founder Pavel Durov.</p><p>“We did notice more users than usual signing up for Telegram globally (about 650,000 new sign-ups just today [Thursday], which is significantly higher than our daily average),” he tells TechCrunch. Back in February Telegram was reporting an average of 350,000 daily signups.</p><p>Following Trump’s election, Durov tweeted that trusting a US-based tech company for secure communications from here on in is “pure madness”.</p><p>During a livestreamed interview on Thursday, Snowden was asked directly for his thoughts about the risk of Trump inheriting a hugely powerful surveillance infrastructure. And while he cautioned against putting too much “faith or fear in elected officials” — pointing out that Obama, far from ripping up mass surveillance, had embraced and deepened it — he did express concern about what he called “a dark moment in our nation’s history”, urging his audience to work together to build pro-privacy tech alternatives.</p><p>He went on to reiterate some of his prior advice, warning that tech companies whose business models are based on data-mining their users inevitably put personal data at risk of access by state agents — name checking Google as a problem company, and conversely singling out end-to-end encrypted messaging app Signal as an example of good practice, noting that when it was subpoenaed it had almost no data to hand over.</p><p>Drawing a clear contrast with products created by Google — Snowden emphasized at one point that “everything you type into that Google prompt is being saved forever” — he went on to argue: “The best way to defend against [surveillance apparatus] is to make sure you do not collect information, as a business, that you do not need.”</p><p>Yet the big huge problem with the vast majority of US-based consumer tech services, is that they do collect personal data as payment for the (‘free’) service. And therefore are at risk of being co-opted by overreaching state surveillance apparatus.</p><p>Indeed, we know this already. The Snowden disclosures of 2013 revealed the Prism program — with its long list of mainstream US tech giants that had agreed to hand over user data to the NSA.</p><p>Point is, if a US tech service can access data, a US tech service can be made to divulge data to an authoritarian US government. So if Trump decides to use the surveillance state to drive an agenda of social division by, for instance, creating a database of all Muslims in the US, he can — and Silicon Valley tech giants will be forced to help him.</p><p>And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>It recently emerged that Yahoo went further than Prisma — agreeing, in 2015, to a custom US government o</p>",

The service allows customers to watch “optimized” video from a number of streaming providers without cutting into their monthly data allotment.</p><p>Today, T-Mobile added support for a few streaming services that were notably missing from their selection of nearly 40 existing services. Online video addicts can now also stream Amazon Video, Fox News, Univision NOW, and their favorite wrestling moments for the WWE Network without cutting into their data plans.</p><p>In addition to announcing the service expansions, T-Mobile also released data on how the service had affected customer’s data consumption and it’s pretty substantial. A study from the carrier finds that users are now streaming twice as much online video as they were before the Binge On program came about.

    "content": "<p>Sometimes one must look to the past to define the future.</p><p>Once upon a time the milkman delivered milk directly to your home. The Avon and Tupperware ladies had private parties in the comfort of a neighbor’s house. The Hoover salesperson demonstrated the vacuum cleaner on your living room carpet. It was a high-touch, well-informed, personalized and customer-friendly experience. What changed all that?</p><p>The automobile. When the majority of consumers could afford a car, they discovered the freedom of driving themselves to the store to see a vast array of products and evaluate them on their own schedule. The retailer also benefitted because the consumer picked up the product and took it home, thereby eliminating their cost of last-mile delivery.</p><p>The reduction in cost was passed on to the consumer, which compensated for the elimination of high-touch customer service. This was taken to its logical conclusion by Costco and IKEA, which essentially had consumers purchase their products at its warehouse locations disguised as retail shops. Nobody complained about being the retailer’s laborer and deliveryman as long as prices were rock-bottom.</p><p>Then came Amazon. It disrupted this cozy relationship by keeping prices low while delivering the product directly to one’s home at no marginal cost for those participating in its Prime program. Now customers could enjoy even wider product selection with Amazon without having to suffer the pains of driving to the store, waiting in line and hauling the goods back home. This particularly benefitted dual-income families, where time became an increasingly more precious commodity.</p><p>But Amazon is about to be disrupted. Retailers will not stand frozen like deer caught in the headlights, and will use technology to leverage the unique assets of brick-and-mortar stores and sales associates. The key is turning idle sales associates into personal shoppers who can provide the high-touch, well-informed, personalized and customer-friendly experience of yesteryear. How is this possible? Say hello to conversational commerce and the autonomous car.</p><p>Conversational commerce enabled by messaging platforms is rapidly becoming the marketing channel of choice in China, where customers are communicating directly with retailers and brands via WeChat. When a customer browses in the store, the sales associate asks if he/she would like to get information about new collections and/or special promotions. If the customer is interested, they exchange WeChat contacts and starts the journey of one-to-one personalized engagement.</p><p>Today, this experience is primarily powered by humans, and the scope is limited to VIP customers. However, as artificial intelligence gets more sophisticated, such personalized engagement will be enabled by bots or a combination of bots and sales associates, and can be scaled to the entire customer base.</p><p>In the U. S., chat platforms, including Facebook Messenger, Kik and Slack, have opened up to help retailers and brands launch chatbots to engage with their customers. It is a one-to-one conversation providing research (product recommendations, prices, promotions, availability, etc.) and post-purchase customer service (delivery, exchange/return, usage, etc.). Because the customer opts in, enabling the retailer to access a plethora of rich and explicit purchase-intent data, the bot or the sales associate can provide valuable advice and recommendations and build a personalized and meaningful relationship with the customer.</p><p>More than 80 retailers and brands, including H&M, Sephora and Staples, have launched human-assisted chatbots on Messenger and/or Kik to provide services such as product recommendations and personalized beauty advice and, of course, the bots also facilitate transactions if the customer is ready to purchase the products. This new wave of conversational commerce has given birth to many startups, such as msg.ai, Conversable and Converse.ai, which focus on helping brands and retailers engage with customers on chat platforms.</p><p>Similar to Uber, which takes idle car drivers and turns them into concierge chauffeurs, conversational commerce will convert idle sales associates into personal shoppers who can convert casual browsing into purchases and build customer loyalty. Again, as AI gets better, much of the interaction can be handled by a bot, and the sales associate can focus on the niche cases and more valuable tasks, such as making sure the customer who visits the store gets full attention and truly experiences the store, and understands the value of the retailer’s chatbot and opts in.</p><p>For multichannel retailers and brands, the store is a true differentiator in this Amazon-centric world. They must leverage their unique assets of sales associates to deliver an optimal in-store experience and start a one-to-one conversation with the customer after he/she leaves the store; when AI kicks in, it becomes a natural continuation of the experience.</p><p>In the not-so-distant future, autonomous cars will enable the sales associate to load merchandise into a car that will drive itself to your home or office, delivering your orders within the same day. The customer can reserve a delivery window and track its location on a map in real time so there is no waiting during a “window of delivery.” The chance of theft of packages left at the door will also be reduced significantly.</p><p>The transportation cost can be further reduced when multiple deliveries are carpooled by the driverless car to your location and sophisticated algorithms are developed to dynamically optimize delivery routes. London-based startup Starship, started by Skype co-founders, has already developed a robotic cart to deliver packages from Hermes and Metro Group, and food from Just Eat and Pronto. Of course, this cart is not quite a driverless car yet, but it gives us a glimpse into the future.</p><p>Ask any car manufacturer or tech giant, and they will tell you that autonomous cars will be the future of transpo</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sony’s PlayStation Vue streaming TV service has just hit a bit of a roadblock in terms of its content lineup. The company says today that it is losing all Viacom-owned channels, including Comedy Central, Spike and MTV, which will be removed from the service beginning on November 11. Reading between the lines of the announcement, it seems that the cost to continue to carry these channels was an issue here, given the move being positioned as the best way for Vue to continue to offer “value” to its customers.</p><p>Channel lineups on services like Vue and its rivals are often in flux due to complicated rights agreements and disputes over pricing. For example, in April, Viacom and Dish settled a carriage dispute that additionally allowed Dish’s Sling TV streaming television service to carry Viacom’s networks, including Comedy Central, BET, Spike, MTV, Nick Jr. and others.</p><p>Meanwhile, Viacom is reportedly in negotiations with Google over its own forthcoming TV service on YouTube, according to The Wall Street Journal and Reuters. And Viacom has already publicly committed to participating in AT&T’s soon-to-launch DirecTV Now streaming service.</p><p>Viacom’s channels, however, have been losing viewers and ad dollars in recent days, worrying investors. And several smaller cable operators, including Suddenlink and Cable One, have dropped Viacom to boost their bottom line, Deadline noted this October.</p><p>But for streaming TV service providers like PlayStation Vue, the channel lineups they’re able to offer consumers will be a key selling point, along with other matters like cost and user experience.</p><p>In this case, it appears that PlayStation is more concerned with keeping its pricing down, even if that means it has to leave out a few notable cable TV networks.</p><p>Reached for comment, a spokesperson for PlayStation Vue declined to offer more information on the matter.</p><p>“While we do not comment on the specific details of our network deals, this was the right decision to make for our customers and the PlayStation business,” they told us. “As part of our ongoing evaluation of the PlayStation Vue offering, we have determined that removing the bundle of channels from Viacom is the best way for us to continue to offer the most compelling value to our customers.”</p><p>In addition to losing Viacom, PlayStation Vue’s announcement also said that it’s adding a few more stations, including BBC America and NBA TV, launching tomorrow, along with VICE and broadcast stations from CBS and Fox soon.</p><p>The company already offers ESPN, ABC and other Disney networks and has added top requested channels like NFL Network and HBO.</p><p>It has also expanded its service to new devices like Roku, Android TV, and the web on Mac and PC, to make Vue more accessible to those without Sony’s gaming platform.</p><p>On paper a lot of these services – like Vue, Sling TV, DirecTV Now, and the soon to arrive live TV service from Hulu – look similar. But consumers will ultimately choose one or the other because of pricing, lineup and other technical and aesthetic concerns. Vue has historically competed on price by offering a tiered service to address different market segments, and it beats Sling TV on the technical front by offering support for more simultaneous streams and a cloud-based DVR.</p><p>Whether or not losing Viacom will actually impact its customer base, however, remains to be seen.</p>",

The price of those still puts them out of reach for low-cost consumer devices.</p><p>2016 and the sales of Next Thing’s $9 computer should help solve that. Voltera’s circuit board printer, which recently received the James Dyson Award, will in turn support faster PCB iterations for those creating their own circuit boards. Interestingly, both projects got their start on Kickstarter.</p><p>3D printing is still there, with some incremental progress, more flexibility and materials. The breakthrough from prototype to product at low-cost is yet to come.</p><p>As smartphones kept improving, including more and more technology, and selling hundreds of millions of units, they gave birth to a flurry of startups leveraging the economies of scale of mobile components.</p><p>Startups are re-imagining daily objects and inventing new devices. Those are gradually finding their way onto people’s wrists, into our homes, workshops and industries.</p><p>Supported by maker spaces incubators and accelerators, a fraction of this explosion of startups moves on to later stage financing. Investment in IOT startups is likely to hit a record height of $2B this year according to CBInsights. Some hardware startups such as Fitbit, Xiaomi or Square have reached unicorn status or liquidity, further fueling the interest of investors.</p><p>Retail is also stepping up its game with a flurry of initiatives to:</p><p>Yet things are also getting harder, faster, and more competitive</p><p>Walk around Maker Faire, then in any consumer electronics trade show and you will understand why the transition from maker to startup has become more difficult. Consumer expectations are higher than ever, and scaling remains difficult, with or without engaging with foreign supply chains.</p><p>Competition looms large and many “smart devices” are becoming commoditized rapidly. Xiaomi and its dozens of satellites are at the forefront of this: cutting out middlemen and using real-time online sales they became the poster child of what we call now “Xiaomization”.</p><p>In just a few years, the prices of numerous devices have fallen by a ratio of 2 to 20. This activity tracker? A mere $10. This action camera? A fraction of GoPro’s price. Those personal mobility things? They are mainstream in China already, and can be yours for less than $300.</p><p>More, the Chinese versions are not only much cheaper but often of equal quality or better made than their “original” counterparts (when those exist). Just how much profit margin is left with all those devices as they transition to commodity status (and into more hands)? And more importantly, which ones are next?</p><p>It’s easy to get hung up on the IP issues. While they do exist in numerous cases (and are sometimes solved in unexpected ways like when Chinese personal mobility startup Ninebot bought Segway), what is equally important here is to realize that the supply chain is a weapon.</p><p>And yet, it’s not just about price, it’s also about speed. Time-to-market is another weapon in the arsenal of hardware startups. Entrepreneurs who dive into the Shenzhen supply chain can equip themselves with both. Obviously, Chinese entrepreneurs have a very real advantage there.</p><p>Chris Anderson, CEO of the drone giant 3DR said at the last MakerCon: “Before, you had 6 years [to evolve from maker to startup], today you have 6 months.”</p><p>It is a matter of time for Chinese startups to run out of low-hanging fruits and emerge with innovative technologies and services. DJI, based in Shenzhen, has thus become the leader in consumer and imagery drones. Let’s wait until new teams spin off from university research and giants like DJI, Huawei, Google and others.</p><p>Even without intense competition, the realities of a hardware business are still the same: you need money to make things. Cash flow issues might simply prevent you from building a business- unless you find suitable suppliers and distributors who will accommodate some of your cash flow needs, and help you to avoid fronting 6 months worth of inventory before you get paid.</p><p>Last, exits in the hardware space have been quite limited this year, after a glorious 2014 with the GoPro IPO and the acquisitions of Nest and Oculus. Fitbit went public but its stock is now trading below its opening price. GoPro is below IPO price. Misfit has just been acquired by the traditional watchmaker Fossil for $260M, about 4x the funding it received. Square is planning to IPO at 7x its funding amount, and below its previous valuation.</p><p>What is relatively new is to see hardware startups being bought to directly join the portfolio of the acquirer: only Google (Nest, Dropcam) and Facebook (Oculus) have done it. Many others buy startups for the team or the technology (the Samsung / SmartThing and Intel / Basis deals come to mind).</p><p>When will we see Sony or Samsung acquire hardware startups for their ‘real’ potential? And when will a software company (apart from Google and Facebook) get into the hardware game?</p><p>The way forward: pick your battles, build faster, cheaper, better and plan for scale</p><p>Picking your battles means going into solving harder problems, that won’t suffer “xiaomization” too quickly. Involve science (medical, material, physics, etc.), software (algorithms, AI) and communities (of users or developers) to build a moat. With this in mind, HAX recently launched five specialized tracks within its program to better support lifestyle products, robotics, health, “IOT enablement” and advanced manufacturing startups.</p><p>Beyond technological prowess, leveraging more software in connected products can help:</p><p>— create health tech products who not only measure but help patients manage their condit</p>",

    "content": "<p>New domain extensions have accumulated some pretty big numbers over the last couple of years. Collective registrations for the new GTLDs (generic top-level domains) have now surpassed 13 million, according to NTLD stats. This number is not small by any means. Comparably speaking, this represents just over 10 percent of total .com registrations, more than 50 percent of the total .net registrations and 30 percent more than total .org registrations.</p><p>While these numbers may not be a surprise to some, they certainly prove the Not-Com revolution (a term coined by Jeff Davidoff, CMO of Donuts, and the largest applicant for new domain-name extensions) is certainly making waves.</p><p>From Lady Gaga (bornthisway.foundation) to Oprah (wherearetheynow.buzz) to Slack (slack.help), thousands of companies have adopted the new domains. Some use one as a primary domain, others for email; others are embracing the very tangible, visual marketing advantage of these.</p><p>Companies spend billions annually on brand building, yet one of the most visible elements that brands have often been forced to use in social media are URL shorteners, owned by another brand. For example, take a look at one of Deadpool’s recent tweets:</p><p>Deadpool uses a URL shortener from bit.ly to promote an external link. In theory this works, because Bitly is a well-trusted brand. However, Deadpool is missing out on a very real opportunity for consistent brand experience by using a custom URL shortener — maybe deadpool.link, dp.link or something that’s more the Deadpool brand than someone else’s.</p><p>Bitly has even started embracing the adoption of Branded Short Domains under their Bitly Enterprise product offering. For example, ATTN.com is a highly popular news site with more than 1.6 million Facebook likes. However, if you look at ATTN’s Twitter feed, you’ll see they use attn.link as a URL shortener.</p><p>Now, visit ATTN.link and you’ll clearly see that the domain name is part of Bitly’s Branded URL enterprise solution product, where Bitly claims users can experience up to a 34 percent CTR increase simply by changing the name of their URL shortener (read Bitly’s case study).</p><p>For brand builders, these custom URL shorteners provide an extremely low-cost solution for maintaining brand consistency. You may have to sacrifice a character or two, but Twitter has discussed expanding the number of characters in future tweets.</p><p>From generic extensions like .help and .link to targeted extensions like .movie and .style, brands may do well to remember they often have the power to control anything left of the dot.</p><p>For those who doubted new domain name extensions, it may be time to widen your perspective and possibly even your ROI — which is, after all, every company’s dream.</p>",

    "content": "<p>An online retailer platform called simply “42” is debuting today at TechCrunch Disrupt NY with new ideas about how to bring the intelligence of online e-commerce tools to brick-and-mortar merchants. The B2B platform provides businesses and brands a way to better connect and personalize their interactions with customers, as well as to gain broader insight into consumer buying patterns, customer loyalty, and more.</p><p>The company was founded just this February by a team which includes Cathy Han, formerly of Procter & Gamble, and Nick Porter, previously of mobile customer engagement solutions provider Benbria. There are two part-time co-founders involved as well: Lucas Lemanowicz of Palantir and Sarah Hum of Google.</p><p>Han explains that the inspiration for building 42 – which, yes, is a nod to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – arose from her work at P&G, whose clients include several large retailers. “My job was to look at the data, and look at where the gaps in their businesses were. It was a huge realization that, as it turns out, a lot of these brick-and-mortar businesses don’t have access to a suite of online tools,” she explains. “They could use technology a lot better to help engage their customers and drive their sales.”</p><p>She felt there was not only an opportunity in developing a suite of online tools for this underserved market, but also because there were few who really understood the industry from both the technology and the retailers’ side.</p><p>42 today is an online B2B platform which uses data from retailers’ point-of-sale systems. That data is manually exported and uploaded into 42’s systems, but the eventual goal is to automate that process. Once online, the business can view a snapshot of key trends among customers and sales in a visual and intuitive dashboard interface. The main screen shows things like total sales, margins, average sales per customer, growth drivers, popular items and best sellers, among other things.</p><p>Another part of the 42 interface offers more granular data about the store’s top customers, including demographic and contact information, past purchases, and more.</p><p>On the consumer side, the system relies on collecting a shopper’s email information at checkout – which could be a challenge given that, historically, this information has only been used to add consumers to mass mailing lists which offered little value.</p><p>So it will be up to the retailers themselves to explain to customers the benefits in now providing this data – that emails will no longer feel spammy and irrelevant, but are instead personalized and customized based on their own individual buying trends and interests.</p><p>For example, if the customer only shops for jeans or shoes at the store, then they might be alerted only when there’s a sale on those items specifically, or when new styles are available. “The idea is to identify purchase patterns just the same way we identify them online, except using point-of-sale data,” says Han. 42 stops short of actually helping retailers craft those personalized messages, however, but it does work with their preferred mailing systems, she notes.</p><p>There are a number of companies attempting to introduce analytics for offline businesses which are similar to those e-commerce retailers use, for example Euclid and Nomi track anonymized customer behavior and in-store trends using mobile location data. 42 is different because it’s about establishing a personal connection with individual customers – even allowing the merchant to identify their most loyal shoppers and top spenders in order to target them with exclusive deals.</p><p>42 got a head start on its industry outreach efforts when it was selected to present at New York’s Fashion Week in mid-February. The company is now in talks with five well-known fashion brands, some of whom are piloting the system now. The plan is to have a beta version available later this summer, with a public launch later this fall.</p><p>Interested retailers or brands can reach out to 42 for inclusion in the beta by signing up for more information here.</p><p>Judges Q&A: Judges in this session included Judges: Nikolaos Bonatsos (General Catalyst), Tracy Chou (Pinterest), Matt Mazzeo (Lowercase Capital), Ron Palmeri (Mk II Ventures). Responses are paraphrased.</p><p>Q: Do you tie profiles from brick-and-mortar to online stores?</p><p>A: Absolutely, that’s the goal. We send a copy of the receipt with the items customers buy to the retailers, and those items could be online items.</p><p>A: Yes, it’s tough. We’re being selective. The ones we’re working on now are some of the larger brands. We can integrate with their email system at point of checkout, or they can pre-load data onto our servers.</p><p>A: We’re working with a couple of CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) brands right now.</p><p>Q: Do you pull all the data into your own systems, and how customized are the analytics?</p><p>A: It depends on preference of retailer. We can access read-only versions. If they want to customize the data a little bit, they can.</p><p>Q: What format is the data coming in?</p><p>A: Whatever is easiest for them. What we’ve seen now is CSV.</p><p>Q: Results you’ve seen so far?</p><p>A: We’re in piloting stages right now.</p>",

    "content": "<p>This past week I made it my mission to see what was going on in downtown Manhattan. A well-timed email here, a hastily caught train there, and I found myself at the headquarters of Priority Cycles — a NYC-based bicycle startup that got its wheels on Kickstarter back in 2014.</p><p>Raising over $565k for its original city bike, called the Classic, resulted in the birth of a niche category: bikes that you could throw around without much need of maintenance, if any. Isn’t that what you’ve always wanted from a bicycle?</p><p>But my visit to the new headquarters of Priority Cycles wasn’t to window shop or to look at the bikes of last year, but to speak to co-founder Dave Weiner, and see the next bike in the lineup. Turns out, it’s a surf bike: characterized by a relaxed riding stance, curved handlebars and mount accessories to accommodate things you’d use at a beach, like a surfboard. Weiner calls it the Priority Coast.</p><p>While the model seen here is a prototype, the core materials and aesthetics will remain the same, with indigo, black, white and “sunset rose” colorways available through the Coast’s Kickstarter page. A single Priority Coast will go for $349, but alas, that’s only for the first 100 backers; the final retail price will be $399. With a name like that and a clean aesthetic, the Priority Surf looks — picturesque. Made of aluminum and stainless steel with sealed cartridge bearings, sand and water will have a hard time ruining your fancy new surf bike. Also, note the lack of traditional bike chain: a Gates Carbon Grease-free belt drive is used instead, meaning this is a fixie surf bike.</p><p>Despite never having needed a surf bike, I can entertain the need of having a rust-proof bike. However, personally I don’t take too much liking to relaxed riding — chalk that up to being a “young man.”</p><p>So while some might not see it aesthetically suited for the urban flora of Manhattan, that Priority Cycles’ choice of materials is robust, results in confidence knowing that the Priority Surf can take a beating near the California surf — or a New York pothole or two.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Bluetooth-powered lost item finder called Tile, which last summer raised $2.6 million via crowdfunding, has finally begun shipping, the company now claims. Early backers may be a bit skeptical, given the delays the company experienced since raising a significant round of funding many months ago, then not being able to deliver in a timely manner. But over the Memorial Day holiday here in the U. S., Tile’s Twitter account has re-tweeted photos of at least one happy customer’s receipt of the Tile device as proof of the shipments as well as other accolades, and promises to publish a more complete ship schedule soon.</p><p>For those wondering when their own Tile will arrive, the company notes that it will ship in order by the date the pre-order was placed. Or in other words, Tile’s earliest backers will receive their devices first, as it should be.</p><p>Despite not having a product on the market (until now, apparently), Tile became one of the buzziest new companies in the connected device space, offering small, affordable, square-shaped dongles which you’re able to attach to real-world items like wallets, bikes, suitcases, bags, keychains and more in order to keep track of them when they go missing. These Tiles, as the dongles are called, work alongside a mobile application that lets you view the Tile’s last known location.</p><p>Meanwhile, the company’s long-term vision is to blanket the world with these little devices, helping to form a distributed network of sorts, as each Tile app will become capable of picking up the location of any Tile marked as lost – meaning that you’d be track down lost items even when your Tile goes out of range (approximately 50-150 ft.)</p><p>Tile gained a lot of attention for its record-breaking crowdfunding campaign last year, but then failed to meet promised deadlines. In the time since its raise, Tile has faced competition from a number of companies hoping to tap into the latent consumer interest in connected devices, and capitalizing on Tile’s inability to meet that demand.</p><p>Devices like Duet, TrackR, StickNFind, Lapa, and others have stepped into fill the void, and yet, Tile with its millions in funding and its thin and sleek devices, still seems to be the one to beat thanks to the viral attention it received in months past.</p><p>The company says Tiles will last for a year before needing to be replaced. (Unlike some other competitors, Tile’s batteries are not user-replaceable.) This is both a positive and a negative, of course. It’s what allows the Tile device its slimmer appearance, but on the other hand, it means consumers will always have to order more dongles, which are more expensive than the batteries themselves.</p><p>Tile is still accepting orders, offering one Tile for $19.95 or four Tiles for $59.85, and more.</p><p>CEO and co-founder Nick Evans recently posted to Tile’s support site that customers will be asked to confirm their shipping address approximately two weeks before their order ships, noting also that early backers should have already received this email.</p><p>In addition, the company released more info on its blog on Friday, showing Tile customers what their package will look like, what their first steps should be, and more about the way the device works. Stay tuned.</p>",

After all, there are plenty of long issues that can be avoided or lessened by living a more active lifestyle, a motivation that becomes all the more apparently as our lives tend increasingly toward the sedentary.</p><p>The jury’s still out on the efficacy of wearables when it comes to long term health issues, but there’s the undeniable immediate effect of making users more conscious of movement as they go about their day. From running and walking to standing, to simply remembering to take some time to breathe, a wrist-worn wearable is a buzzing reminder to mix things up a bit.</p><p>A number of health insurance companies have embraced wearables as a way to get their subscriptions to be more activity, including Aetna, which recently announced a major plan to subsidize the Apple Watch.

    "content": "<p>The holiday season is here. For many of us that means lots of shopping. Are you doing most of your shopping online or in stores? If you’re like most consumers, the answer is both, but with a significant bias toward physical stores.</p><p>Despite all the attention about Cyber Monday and online transactions, e-commerce sales will still only amount to roughly 7 percent of all retail sales this year.</p><p>Online and mobile shopping can be incredibly convenient — a repeat order on Amazon takes seconds; Instacart can turn a trip to the grocery store into a one-minute session on your phone. Online shopping also allows you to browse hundreds of products, compare items of interest and get recommendations about similar items.</p><p>But what if you’re buying something you need to see, feel or experience in person? Clothes, furniture or art, for example. You could order these items online and return them if they don’t work out, but it’s an awkward process that defeats a lot of the convenience of online shopping.</p><p>Efforts have been made to combine the best of online retail with the best of shopping in the physical world. Online-first retailers like Amazon, Warby Parker and Bonobos have opened physical stores to allow customers to experience their products in person. Brick-and-mortar retailers have “omnichannel” initiatives to better synchronize their online and offline offerings. The result, however, has been that little has changed. Department stores today look very similar to department stores 100 years ago.</p><p>Why have attempts to bring technology into physical retail largely failed? There are three requirements for technology adoption in retailing. First, the technology must help customers do what they came to the store to do — find and experience products. Second, the ROI for the retailer must be crystal clear and compelling. And, finally, the experience must enhance the magic of a great real-world retail experience, without distracting.</p><p>Retailers or tech entrepreneurs frequently fall short on at least one of these requirements.</p><p>For instance, many retailers have created their own apps hoping customers will use them in-store for product discovery and comparison. These almost inevitably violate the third requirement. If a customer is in a well-designed physical space to look at physical products, why would they want to be looking at text and images on a small screen on their phone? The barrier of downloading and logging into an app for one store is also typically prohibitive.</p><p>Then there are video walls, which are often a piece of non-tech passed off as tech. Retailers sometimes put large video displays on the shop floor, often near checkout areas or fitting rooms. These displays aren’t interactive, and often show products that aren’t available in the store. They don’t help consumers and they don’t generate an ROI for the retailer.</p><p>Maybe you’ve had an associate use a tablet to show you content or to discuss products. While not inherently a bad idea, this often amounts to the associate browsing the retailer’s website with you on an iPad. Conversely, consumer-facing tablets in the store typically make customers feel like they are doing the work of the associate, and are rarely a magical experience.</p><p>So what’s the right answer for technology in physical retail? The tech that will get adopted will be beautiful and seamlessly integrated into the physical environment. It will actually save you time and help you shop. And it will help the retailer better understand what’s working and what’s not, while better serving you in the future. Finally, the technology that gets adopted in retail will be hidden from view. It won’t feel like technology. It will feel like a great personal shopper guiding you through an elegant store, with wonderful products to be discovered.</p><p>We’re seeing some progress. Wing is an investor in Oak Labs, which is pioneering a new approach to interactive technology in retail stores (Ralph Lauren is a launch partner). Oak’s first product is a connected fitting room that knows the items you’ve brought in. The mirror can help you request another size or color, as well as recommend other items you might want to try on.</p><p>Other companies are innovating here, as well. RetailNext is more behind-the-scenes in its quest to turn retail shops into data systems, drawing insights from both physical and digital data sources in and around stores. The company, which lists Bloomingdale’s and Brookstone amongst its customers, posted recently about the changes that need to occur in physical retail, calling out the need for these to be “in tune” with shoppers’ demands for such things as price transparency and consistency from digital to offline commerce.</p><p>That demand for consistency has created an opportunity for startups such as Boston-based NewStore, which wants to make the omnichannel experience a more seamless one, with a mobile platform that links online and offline activity. NewStore launched earlier this year with $38 million in funding; its first customer is a company that provides services to brands such as Jimmy Choo, Bally and Belstaff.</p><p>Slyce, which is publicly traded in Canada, provides a visual product-search portfolio to retailers, helping them convert photo searches to instant purchases. Slyce’s technology is used by large retail brands such as Neiman Marcus, Tilly’s, JCPenney and Home Depot.</p><p>For the past two decades, Silicon Valley has focused almost exclusively on a niche of retail that accounts for a single-digit percentage of overall sales — e-commerce. It’s time to think about the other 93 percent.</p>",

S., only on T-Mobile phones and requires that you have a messaging plan (unless you want to be charged). Despite these restrictions, the app itself is pure genius – it cleverly uses SMS and MMS to send requests and receive the content. And to the end user, the app appears to work just like your own Android phone’s browser, only a bit slower.</p><p>The Smozzy app is very basic – just a combo URL/search bar at the top and a keyboard below. You can type in your search query in the URL bar or you can type in the exact URL you want Smozzy to retrieve.</p><p>The end user requests are sent to Smozzy’s servers by SMS and the responses are sent back via MMS. Here’s where things get tricky. Smozzy downloads the requested page and all its resources (stylesheets, images, etc.) and puts everything into a Zip file. The file is then encoded as a PNG and the PNG is sent out via MMS. It’s downright hack-tastic!</p><p>That said, you should be aware that Smozzy’s messages aren’t encrypted, so you shouldn’t try to browse secure content or send passwords via the app. (Sorry, no Facebooking, folks.)</p><p>Unbelievably, the app works exactly as promised. I tested it this morning on my HTC Sensation with no problems. The webpages aren’t stripped down in any way, and functional as usual, with links intact.</p><p>The folks on Hacker News are going crazy for this app, as well they should. (And yes, that’s where I discovered it). There have even been offers to help with hosting.</p><p>The concept behind Smozzy isn’t entirely novel, however, it’s just rare to see such an idea implemented outside developing markets. For example, in summer 2010, I wrote about an HP Labs technology called SiteonMobile which allows mobile users to surf the Web via SMS.</p><p>But with SiteonMobile, the onus was on the Web publisher to use small widget-like tools called “tasklets” to aid in site navigation via SMS. With Smozzy, though anything on the Web is available, and publishers don’t have to make any changes on their end.</p><p>Smozzy is the creation of recent UT Austin grad, now Berkeley graduate student, Jeff Donahue. He says he came up with the idea a couple of years ago when he had a BlackBerry phone with no data plan. Donahue doesn’t have any future plans for the app, since testing the app non-T-Mobile carriers hasn’t really worked out.</p><p>The only question now is whether or not T-Mobile will shut it down. Hopefully, the carrier won’t see Smozzy as threat – after all, although it lets you surf the Web without a data plan, it’s not a very efficient means to do so.</p><p>Updated: 11:30 AM with details on developer.</p>",

This made it easy for the company to test the impact of the tool on its workers. When all was said and done, Pep Boys had cut OSHA related expenses by $15 million and even managed to reduce theft by $25 million in the process.</p><p>Perhaps most interestingly, the idea for Axonify itself originated from the minds of a marketing couple that is now over the age of 70. Their trick to cutting these costs lies in overcoming the overconfidence of some workers, while tapping into the insights of introverts. Carol Leaman, CEO of Axonify, explains that this breaks down to a three-step process.</p><p>First, Axonify emphasizes the repetition of core concepts with dynamic spacing tailored for each individual. The repetition, which aids in memory retention, is then augmented with a regular recall schedule. Forcing yourself to remember things periodically helps them to stay fresh in your brain. Lastly, Axonify captures confidence along with responses. The idea being that once people are made aware of the correlation between their confidence and accuracy, they are more likely to break out of their bad habits.</p><p>The games themselves are device agnostic and can be played on everything from a computer to a point of sale terminal. They resemble traditional arcade games, but can come packaged in the form of a round of golf, or even something like Candy Crush.</p><p>Throughout play, at meaningful points of accomplishment, users are prompted to answer questions. These questions are specific to the user in difficulty and content. None of the engagement is required, but managers retain access to a dashboard that they can refer back to later when recommending actions to increase performance.</p><p>“Companies struggle to monitor return on investment in this space,” noted Matt Emery, general partner at JMI Equity.</p><p>It makes sense that companies are weary of new HR solutions simply because there are so many on the market that promise to be a silver bullet. But both Leaman and Emery insist that Axonify isn’t designed to replace existing products from other vendors. Its application to knowledge retention just happens to represent a large overlapping enterprise market.</p>",

    "content": "<p>In 2016, Walmart plans to close 269 stores. Macy’s plans 36 closures, and Kohl’s 18. Is this the beginning of the end for brick-and-mortar retailers?</p><p>There has been much speculation about what retailers should do in an omni-channel world. How do they compete in a world where Amazon is undercutting them in prices and offering free delivery? How should they respond when brands are increasingly ignoring channel conflict and launching their own e-commerce stores?</p><p>Rather than trying to predict the future with a crystal ball, retailers can learn from other industries that preceded them with disruptive technology and innovators. What steps did the incumbents take to fight off the digital onslaught, and what worked to keep them not only competitive but gave them an advantage? There are numerous lessons that can help formulate a long-term growth strategy for retail stores.</p><p>After the demise of music retailers and bookstores, movie theaters were in the crosshairs of the digital revolution. Netflix, Red Box and Video on Demand had already put most video rental stores out of business. With home entertainment systems becoming more and more sophisticated, why should consumers drive to theaters and pay $12 to watch a movie when they can enjoy the same fare in the comforts of their own homes for $4? It looked like movie theaters would follow the same path of self-destruction.</p><p>Yet in 2015, movie box office sales increased 7.4 percent — and show no signs of slowing down. Why did technology not put movie theaters six feet under? The answer lies in understanding what benefits a theater provides that a DVD, Blu-ray, Roku or Hulu cannot. At its core, a 90-minute movie is a fantasy experience, best enjoyed in an immersive environment. The big screen and surround-sound system with state-of-the-art speakers delivers a far more powerful entertainment experience than any home system — where there may also be numerous interruptions by family members or pets.</p><p>This realization led theater owners to invest even more to differentiate themselves from home entertainment systems, i.e. IMAX screens, 3D technology and Dolby sound systems. They also have reduced the pain points by installing bigger and more comfortable seats, serving healthy and more delicious food and providing advanced ticket purchase with pre-selected seating. As a result, movie theaters have stemmed the tide of entertainment streaming directly into the home and regained the upper hand in convincing Hollywood studios to extend the exclusivity periods for their products to be in theaters.</p><p>Another prime example is in sports. Improvements in LCD technology with bigger flat-screen TVs offering high-definition pictures should have induced fans to watch more games at home instead of going to the stadium. Yet ticket prices have continued to climb, with no shortage of demand for season tickets and corporate boxes. Once again, the key is to understand that the core of sports entertainment is fanaticism.</p><p>People love their teams and want to be immersed in environs where they can celebrate with other fans in a mob environment. This cannot be replicated at home, even while watching with a group of friends. As a result, team owners are upgrading their stadiums to offer better seating, food and alcohol. They also are removing pain points by adding more parking spaces and access to public transportation.</p><p>Brick-and-mortar retail stores are facing the same challenges from the digital revolution. There is little technology or innovation in-store to make it a more compelling experience over purchasing something online. It is equivalent to an old-style movie theater on Main Street: The screen is small, the sound system is old, the seats are hard and only popcorn is available at the concession stand. On top of that, there is no parking lot. Why would anyone go to that theater if it doesn’t provide an immersive experience that a home system cannot?</p><p>Retailers need to understand the benefits of the in-store experience to a consumer. At its core are discovery, trial and instant gratification. Retail stores need to delight the customer by suggesting merchandise options that are unexpected yet appropriate once the consumer enters the store. This means utilizing data collected about the customer online, offline and mobile, including past searches, purchases and abandoned carts. Sales associates must be more knowledgeable about products and their benefits and understand customers’ needs and preferences.</p><p>One of the tools to empower sales associates is Tulip, which integrates product, inventory, e-commerce and purchase data to give sales associates the best information to deliver the most seamless experience to the customers. With more data, sales associates can answer customer questions, upsell and cross-sell more effectively, and truly delight customers.</p><p>If the products are not in stock in one particular store, sales associates can look up inventory on their e-commerce site or other store locations so that customers can still complete the transaction in-store and have the products delivered to them. No more lost sales. If the customer opts in, sales associates also can communicate with them after the store visit. Retailers such as Toys R Us, Coach and Bonobos are leveraging Tulip to improve the in-store shopping experience and increase sales.</p><p>Additionally, pain points such as long lines must be reduced by adding comfortable fitting rooms and mobile checkouts. Seattle-based startup Hointer solves these problems by equipping the fitting rooms with tablets where the customer can pick different sizes and other products, which are then delivered into the fitting room through a chute. This solution eliminates the pain point of having to leave and come back to the fitting room. Hointer also provides mobile check-outs to complete a seamless shopping experience in-store.</p><p>A seamless and magical in-store shopping experience can only be accomplished with greater investments in technol</p>",

    "content": "<p>Twilio, the developer-centric communications platform that successfully IPOed earlier this year, published a new study today about how consumers want to use tech to talk to businesses and brands. The study, which the market research firm Vanson Bourne performed for Twilio by surveying 6,000 consumers in Europe, Asia and North America, shows that nine out of ten consumers would like to be able to use messaging to talk to businesses. The majority of businesses, however, don’t yet have the infrastructure in place to do so right now.</p><p>Given that it’s Twilio’s bread and butter to provide this kind of infrastructure to businesses, it’s worth taking the results with a grain of salt, of course. What they do highlight, though, is that while consumers overall prefer messaging over face-to-face interactions with businesses (and millennials even more so), businesses haven’t quite caught up to this new world yet.</p><p>According to Twilio’s survey, for example, 66 percent of consumers now prefer to reach brand (or be reached by brands) though messaging apps. Which apps they want to use depends on geography, of course, given that the global messaging market remains fragmented, that’s no surprise. Globally, 47 percent of users prefer native text messages when communicating with brands, followed by Facebook Messenger (21 percent), Whatsapp (18 percent), LINE (6 percent), and Snapchat (2 percent).</p><p>What’s also interesting is that 85 percent of consumers surveyed here want to be able to not just get messages from brands but also be able to answer them using the same channels.</p><p>Because no survey is complete (or able to generate headlines) without some kind of sex question, consumers were also asked if they were more willing to give up sex or messaging. Ten percent said they would rather give up sex.</p>",

Musically reports that the two services will be separate. Line has partnered with Avex Digital and Sony Music Entertainment for its upcoming Japanese service and now we know it is tapping an existing player to cover its overseas markets.</p><p>MixRadio itself claims “millions” of Windows Phone users from across 31 countries, although it is yet to launch for iOS or Android. Buying the service saves Line the considerable investment in time and money that comes with negotiating licensing deals in each of these markets.</p><p>The move is another example of Line’s strategy to develop its messaging application beyond chat and into a mobile entertainment platform. Line users can already play games, follow celebrities and brands and buy stickers while the company launched a payments service two days ago — it also has plans to introduce taxi-booking and food delivery services in its native Japan.</p><p>Japan, Taiwan and Thailand are Line’s largest market — accounting for over half of its active users — but it is focused on developing its popularity overseas. It claimed traction in Spain, Mexico and parts of Latin America, and tapping into MixRadio’s user base might help it increase its visibility and reach.</p><p>Likewise, the deal stands to benefit MixRadio. It doesn’t provide raw user numbers but is almost certainly trailing the likes of Spotify, Beats, Pandora and Rdio. A partner like Line could help popularize the service and give its eventual Android and iOS apps a running start.</p><p>Finally, the deal also signifies the growing influence and global ambition of Asia’s top technology firms. This isn’t Line’s first acquisition, but it is its first outside of Asia and it could be a sign of things to come as the company, China’s WeChat and Korea’s Kakao Talk up their focus on multimedia and reaching users outside of Asia.</p>",

It already lets users jointly watch media like YouTube or Spotify, but now it is adding Twitch — which Amazon bought for around $1 billion in 2013 — to the mix. Twitch users, as we reported earlier this year, watch more videos each month than the average YouTube user does.</p><p>“Twitch has revolutionized the way we enjoy our favorite games, and now with Airtime, you can enjoy that same content in an intimate setting with your closest friends. For the first time, Airtime lets you video chat while you watch your favorite Twitch streams live­­ — even Pokémon GO!,” Airtime wrote in a blog post.</p><p>It’s been a busy year for Airtime.

    "content": "<p>“No one’s private life can totally withstand public scrutiny,” reads an NYT op-ed penned by screenwriter and playwright Aaron Sorkin, angrily blasting the media for reporting the private details revealed through the recent hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment, in what’s shaping up to be one of the largest corporate data breaches to date. “…Every news outlet that did the bidding of the [hacking group] Guardians of Peace is morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable,” he adds.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sony Pictures – blithely ignoring the First Amendment (and the Streisand effect) – has threatened legal action against journalists reporting on the findings from the stolen documents.</p><p>Sorkin and Sony are both wrong. Sony may be a victim, but there is data in the breach that’s worth reporting to the public – but not the social security numbers, private and personal information, or insider-y emails about films. That those things were stolen, however? Yes. Especially since former employees weren’t even being made aware of the situation.</p><p>In addition, one of the largest takeaways is for other corporations to react to Sony’s cautionary tale and beef up its own servers and security infrastructure.</p><p>Sony’s hack was made worse by its poor security infrastructure, but that alone does not mean all the data needed to be revealed in detail by the press – if that’s Sorkin’s critique, it would be accurate. But he would rather none of the content be reported. That’s not correct.</p><p>One thing the world needs to understand immediately is that all information can be made public, and the only real privacy protection is that its exposure has yet to be targeted by determined hackers. Over the past several years, hackers have stolen consumers’ personal information and credit card numbers from some of the largest retailers. They’ve pulled nude photos off celebrity’s phones and from “private” messaging app Snapchat. Large companies like Adobe and eBay have seen emails and other personal account information stolen. And whistleblowers like Snowden have revealed the most private and devastating aspects of government spying agendas.</p><p>There is literally nothing that is above being exposed publicly if the right people are focused on a specific agenda. Sony did not take the necessary protections to mitigate against this level of damage.</p><p>The Sony hack was carried out by a group referring to itself as the “Guardians of Peace.” The group has demanded that Sony pull its upcoming movie “The Interview,” starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, which was based on a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The group has leaked a number of Sony movies online including the yet-to-be released remake of “Annie,” plus “Mr. Turner,” “Still Alice,” and “To Write Love on Her Arms,” alongside large data dumps from inside Sony’s corporate network.</p><p>The reaction, however, of hacking victims like Sony should not include tantrums like those now demonstrated by Sorkin and the studio itself. They should only offer apologies to employees, if they say anything at all. Apologies for making the hack just so damned easy, keeping some of the company’s most private information on its operations, its employees (and their families) in unencrypted Excel and Word files and carelessly shared emails. That’s not to blame the victims themselves, though – individuals make mistakes, but corporate IT policies are meant to protect those mistakes from becoming publicly shared data.</p><p>Sony Pictures, one of the U. S.’s largest studios, has now, somewhat ridiculously, asked journalists to destroy the stolen documents, and warned that those who didn’t comply will face further action, the company threatened via letters sent to a number of online and print publishers. “Sony Pictures Entertainment will have no choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss arising from such use or dissemination by you,” the letter states.</p><p>News media has reported on a number of these leaked emails, which have included private jabs, jokes and commentary, including a director referring to Hollywood star Angelina Jolie as a “spoiled brat,” Sony’s botching of the Steve Jobs movie, and racist riffs between studio co-chairman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin about what President Obama’s favorite movies might be.</p><p>One could argue that those sorts of details, as Sorkin claims, were exploited for pageviews more so than public good. That’s true in some cases. But that’s not looking at the bigger picture related to the media’s coverage of the hack.</p><p>Beyond providing fodder for gossip blogs, the Sony hack has also revealed serious information that’s arguably more serving of the “public interest.” (Hint: that’s what journalists are supposed to cover – a topic, incidentally, that Sorkin’s own show HBO’s “The Newsroom” has grappled with recently, when its reporters for a fictional news network resembling CNN landed a treasure trove of stolen Department of Defense documents.)</p><p>The Sony hack has displayed a lot about the failing of our modern, wired corporate culture. Like just how casual internal company HR employees treat email communication, for example.</p><p>Email is not private; as a former IT worker, I could have accessed any inbox on my domain (and often did, though not for reading emails, but for legitimate reasons like backup, archiving, or transfer to a new hire). But more importantly, employees dealing with sensitive information seem not to understand that email is not a place where an HR employee needs to be detailing a child’s medical treatment, where that treatment is taking place, the child’s name, how the child was doing in treatment, and more.</p><p>Sony, and likely other organizations that are currently fortunate enough to not have their poor security policies exposed, also does not seem to understand that if you’re choosing to record Social Security numbers, birth dates and salaries in Excel spreadsheets, you should protect them with at least a minimum amount of security</p>",

    "content": "<p>After a successful crowdfunding campaign that raised $250,000 and a first-generation product that promised remote viewing of anyone coming to your front door over your home network, Doorbot is rebranding as Ring, and introduced redesigned hardware with more of a focus on home security, and a design that should help it better fit in with its surroundings and compliment existing house design choices.</p><p>Ring founder and CEO Jamie Siminoff admits that while Doorbot was mostly a success, it was also very much a first-generation product, complete with its own flaws and shortcomings, the feedback from which went into informing the design of Ring. Ring as a brand is designed to encompass more than just a telepresence solution for your front door; the intent was to create a company image that could apply to total home security, with a view to the future and connected home treatment of home protection.</p><p>“With the Ring doorbell, early on when we were designing it, we decided what we were really doing was designing the alarm system literally turned inside out,” Siminoff said. “Not an alarm system that copied what ABT is doing, what Canary is doing, or even what Dropcam was doing with its window and door systems, but actually building some kind of pre-crime system.”</p><p>Ring can alert users to motion as soon as it’s detected, in addition to recording video, alerting users to any potential crime before it even happens. Often this means they can remotely “answer” the door even if they’re on the other side of the world, which can be enough to prevent something before it’s even happened. Two-way communication on the device works like a phone call, instead of the push-to-talk features of the Doorbot, which makes it easier to communicate with whoever’s at the door, and wide-angle video is also recorded to the cloud in HD resolution.</p><p>Whereas Doorbot was designed primarily as a doorbell, Ring is conceived of as a security measure first, and Siminoff admits that in addition to its functional evolution, the hardware has also gotten much better in terms of design.</p><p>“The Doorbot, I think it turned out in the end to be a ‘good’ product, but I certainly wouldn’t say it was the best product,” Siminoff said in an interview. “We now sort of looked at the world with, ‘we have to compare our products to Apple, regardless of whether we compete with them or not,’ and I don’t think we succeeded at that level.”</p><p>Siminoff says that regardless of whether a gadget they’re creating is something that Apple is also currently selling, it behooves any hardware maker out there to compare themselves to Cupertino, because that’s what years of iPhone sales have done to consumer expectations. Even Apple, to some extent, is battling with its own good reputation, Siminoff points out, and general consumers now expect that level of quality and design from all their various electronic devices.</p><p>But the main selling point, Siminoff says, will still be its role in adding another layer to a sense of security. That’s because it fits into a role where a large portion of daytime crime is happening anyway.</p><p>“We started to see with [Doorbot] very quickly, that the appearance of being home or being home was one of the best preventative measures for daytime crime,” Siminoff said. “Over 1 million burglaries [per year] just in the U. S. alone occur during the day when no one’s home. It’s one of the most likely crimes for you to be affected by from a statistical side, and 80 percent of those crimes start with the front door.”</p><p>With Doorbot, the startup was hearing from customers that they would talk to people at the front door they’d describe as “sketchy,” and these people would think they were home (even if they were communicating via the Doorbot app remotely) and then leave. This led to a shift in focus, whereby Ring would become the ambassador and guardian o the key front entryway, in addition to providing convenience around sending away visitors you aren’t interested in speaking to and communicating with delivery personnel.</p><p>Ring is available for pre-order now, for $199 until November 1st, at which time it goes back to the full price of $249. It comes in four different finishes, and free cloud-based video recording until January 1, 2015, at which time subscription options will be available. The device works with both iOS and Android, connects via Wi-Fi and is weather sealed. It can record 720p video at 30fps, has infrared LEDs for nighttime recording and features a 5,200mAh rechargeable battery (so it doesn’t require power, but it does require charging). Orders start shipping on November 3rd to early pre-order customers.</p><p>I asked Siminoff if he sees any immediate threat from the Dropcam-owned Google, or other competitors, and he says that he definitely sees them heading in this direction, but believes they’ve got enough of a head start and experience in this category to prevail. My main interest in a device like this is still making sure the UPS guy doesn’t immediately bolt after ringing the doorbell, but home security and a new, more professional look could help Ring become a standard fixture in a lot more modern homes.</p>",

For example, I live in a reasonably rural suburb of San Francisco where the long, winding residential streets can make for a time-consuming delivery process.</p><p>It’s in locations like these where carriers could implement a hybrid delivery system. Companies may be deploying large trucks with an on-board drone fleet, enabling packages to be delivered to a few homes at once. The truck would park in one area and the drones would be sent out to deliver packages around that location. Then, they would return to the truck and nestle into charging bays.</p><p>The truck would drive to the next location, which would be optimized based on the addresses for each set of deliveries. That way, the truck is responsible for the longer haul, while the drones can more easily access the hard-to-reach mailboxes, making for an efficient package-delivery process.</p><p>Startups and tech giants are getting their feet wet in the delivery industry by focusing on the local market. Specifically, once one of the major carriers delivers the package to a local warehouse or retailer, these regional delivery companies take over and drop off the product on the consumer’s terms, typically same-day or next-day.</p><p>One popular business model for local delivery is crowdsourcing. Amazon Flex and UberRUSH have made big strides in this arena, hiring everyday folks to drive their own cars, pick up a package and drop it off with the recipient.</p><p>While it may seem like local delivery is here to stay, it might take some time before we see widespread adoption. My company Endicia surveyed 1,000 consumers and discovered that 61 percent of respondents have never used a shipping startup. But if same-day delivery is able to make its way to more cities, there’s hope for shipping startups to take off — 67 percent of respondents said they would use new crowdsourced services like Amazon Flex or UberRUSH to receive a package.</p><p>With a strong groundwork laid in 2015, and new options available from startups, retailers, tech companies and established shipping players like USPS Metro Post, local delivery will be a trend to watch in the new year.</p><p>Let’s get one thing clear: Despite the evolving delivery game, there are certain aspects of shipping that won’t be changing any time soon. While shipping startups continue to make a dent in the industry, there will always be a reliance on the main carriers: FedEx, UPS and the U. S. Postal Service.</p><p>We’re seeing many new players test the shipping waters with local delivery, but there’s still a need to transport goods longer distances, say from San Francisco to New York, which will be harder to achieve without the network and infrastructure of one of the major carriers.</p><p>In the future, all of these new technologies fit cohesively into a package-delivery puzzle, each option working in unison to meet customer needs. Crowdsourced delivery will likely find its footing in urban areas, and drone delivery can be a useful tool in rural locations.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Tech is as much a liability as it is an opportunity, as this election demonstrated. The next few years will be scary for many reasons, and to some more than others, and part of that will be the continued and likely expanded exploitation of the technologies and services we’ve come to rely on. Communities likely to be targeted by Trump policies may want to take a few steps online to help ensure their safety and privacy.</p><p>Trump has gone on the record asking for backdoors to encryption and devices, saying he supports surveillance, and is against Net Neutrality. Policies pursuant to these goals will necessarily put your data at risk.</p><p>The following are privacy tips anyone can use, but they are particularly relevant for anyone who, for example, plans to participate in protests or grassroots organizing, or for undocumented immigrants who would like to decrease their online presence. I’ve listed them roughly in order of importance.</p><p>If Trump makes good on his promise to make deportation of undocumented immigrants, you can expect police to bring the same measures they use in serious crimes to bear on this task. One such measure is the interception of mobile phone calls and messages, whether using a Stingray-type device (which imitates a cell tower, causing phones to send it data instead) or more traditional tapping at the network level.</p><p>Ordinary phone calls and text messages are incredibly easy to collect this way, and are often also exposed as part of other investigations. It’s easily imagined that the police may run a dragnet in areas densely populated by immigrants and watch for keywords pertaining to under the table employment, family across the border, remittances, and so on.</p><p>They can’t do that if you’re using an app like Signal, which uses “end-to-end encryption,” preventing electronic snooping anywhere along the line — including on the service’s own servers and while the data is in transit between networks and devices. This type of encryption is the bane of every authority because not only can they not see what is being sent, nor can the company that runs it, so the information can’t be subpoenaed or hacked out.</p><p>It may be a pain, but getting your family and friends switched over to one of these apps could prevent a lot of trouble down the line.</p><p>Some other options, if for some reason Signal doesn’t work: WhatsApp is a popular and versatile option, but it’s owned by Facebook, and while it’s technically independent, that still makes us nervous. Apple’s iMessage is reliable and popular, but requires an iOS device or Mac — Apple is also under tremendous scrutiny, having been called out specifically by Trump as a company to put pressure on.</p><p>Avoid Allo and Telegram, which have been criticized for their encryption and privacy choices.</p><p>Trump’s naked xenophobia, tacit support of vigilantism, and lack of concern over police militarization and brutality suggest it may soon become far less safe for people of color, Muslims and Sikhs, LGBT individuals and other targeted minorities to walk home alone. Tech can’t prevent bigotry and bashing, but it can at the very least help create a safety net.</p><p>Apps like Kitestring and Companion let you set emergency contacts, and if you, for example, don’t check in at home within 15 minutes, or if you shake the phone hard for 5 seconds, it will send them your location and a message that you need help. (They use SMS, but we’ll make an exception in this case.)</p><p>It’s scary and unfair that this should even have to be recommended, but it’s an opportunity to protect yourself using technology you already have. Check with some friends and see what app looks best.</p><p>Part of the fun of social networks is the idea that you’re sharing with the world. But law enforcement also uses them as investigative tools, establishing whereabouts, work history, and anything else that your posts imply. Like anything you say to the police, this can and will be used against you, and if you have reason to think you may be targeted by them, you should make it difficult to get at. Making your account private is an easy way to do that, even if it’ll be harder to garner followers.</p><p>Be sure to check your preferences and privacy settings in every app and service and opt out of things like default public check-ins or anything with “personalized,” “tailored,” or “curated” in it — it means they’re reading your data.</p><p>On Google, you should turn off (“pause”) your location history and opt out of other tracking measures in the search and ads areas. On your phone, you can turn off location services or restrict them per app. Using an alternative to Google, like DuckDuckGo, helps keep your browsing habits private.</p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a plug-in for Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers that forces them to make a secure connection even when it isn’t the default for the website or service you’re connecting to. You’ll also be warned when the connection isn’t secure (browsers also tell you this, but not very loudly).</p><p>The latest versions of Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS don’t bring just the latest features, but also lots of fixes for serious security holes. These fixes will apply to a few of the previous versions, but not really old ones. Hackers — and the authorities — know this. If your phone and OS are new enough to take full advantage of encryption tools and resist well-known methods for unlocking and hacking, they’re secure against adversaries domestic and foreign.</p><p>It isn’t always easy to stay updated, but keep it in mind when buying a new phone or computer. If you’re on an OS more than a year or two old — before things like full-disk encryption were standard — you should consider updating at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Slightly older iPhones will still get the critical updates (mainly iOS 8) that added broader encryption, as will Nexus phones and other flagship devices. Budget (but still modern) phones like the Moto E and G are also great options for those on a budget.</p><p>Virtual Private </p>",

    "content": "<p>Two years after the first reports of an IPO emerged, Japan’s Line Corporation — the company behind the popular messaging app Line, and possibly the first of the big messaging apps to go public — today announced that it has filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange in the U. S. and the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Japan, trading as LN. The company today said in a news release that the NYSE listing is planned for July 14 with the Tokyo listing on July 15. The Tokyo exchange has already approved its listing of common stock, and the SEC F-1 filing for the U.S. part of the IPO will appear later today, the company added.</p><p>The announcement in English linked above did not provide details of how much Line, which is valued at over $4 billion, plans to raise, but those numbers have been made public on documents filed on the Tokyo exchange (in Japanese), and Line has confirmed the numbers to me directly: it hopes to raise $1 billion (113 billion yen) in the IPO, offering 35 million shares with an over-allotment of 5.25 million shares and 13 million of that in Japan. Pricing will be set June 27, with final price revealed July 11. The offering values the company at ¥588 billion ($5.5 billion).</p><p>The company tells me that it now has 218 million monthly active users globally, with 152 million in its top 4 countries in Asia. It will be aiming to use the huge fundraise to take on growth in new markets.</p><p>“After rounds of serious investigations, we determined that it is important that we are evaluated on the same market as other top global services. Furthermore, listing on the NYSE will help strengthen our branding as a global company,” a spokesperson told me. “LINE is a company that takes on challenges, and our simultaneous listing in Japan and the US is a declaration that we are ready to take on the world.”</p><p>Competitors like Messenger and WhatsApp, both owned by Facebook, cumulatively have billions of users. Other rivals include Rakuten-owned Viber and China’s WeChat (owned by Tencent). Line is one of the biggest of the messaging apps to still remain independent of any larger owner, and the first to go public.</p><p>Line has been evaluating an IPO since 2014, with the first reports emerging exactly two years to the date of its proposed actual listing.</p><p>“LINE, a principal subsidiary of the Company, is evaluating a potential listing in Japan and/or the United States. In connection therewith, LINE has submitted certain documentation, including a listing application, to relevant authorities such as the Tokyo Stock Exchange,” a company spokesperson at the time told me in an email. “However, determinations regarding whether to ultimately list, listing venue and listing timing, etc, have not been made. We will provide an update once such determinations are made or within one month of this disclosure.”</p><p>It’s not clear whether Line thought the market would rise even more ahead, or if it still thought it could use a delay to scale more before a listing and use the time to improve its monetization. All of those have happened to some extent, with the launch of a raft of new services and features, some of which (such as third-party services ordered, paid for and delivered within the app’s messaging framework) replicated elsewhere.</p><p>But on the financial front, times have really changed in the last two years. When reports first emerged of the company looking to list, it was actually estimated to be valued at around ¥1 trillion — almost double today’s valuation, which is a mark perhaps of how over-inflated prices were then, or how tough the messaging market is and appears to be consolidating rapidly with the big simply getting bigger.</p><p>The NYSE proposed IPO, the company said, will be of a new listing of American Depository Shares representing shares of common stock. It’s notable not just for the size of the IPO, but also because of the fact that this is the first time that a Japanese company is listing both in Tokyo and the NYSE.</p>",

The real star of the show was the “LEF,” however, a 1/4-inch thick display that out-thins Panasonic’s surprise from last year.</p><p>Unfortunately, nobody knew a thing about it. “Straight out of Korea,” said one LG rep. “I’ve never even heard of this thing,” said another. So basically, it’s a prototype and not for sale, which isn’t that much of a surprise. It also had a huge brick for a base, which I assume held the guts. By the way, in the video above, I say that the LEF is an OLED display, but I really have no basis for that. Just completely making it up. And the little ones aren’t OLED either. Just small household LCDs.</p><p>The new LE line of LED-backlit TVs, however, is well-documented. They’re quite large and fairly expensive, but that is the way of the HDTV world. If you think back to last CES, we saw the beginnings of the “connected TV” movement, and this is LG catching up. The TVs offer Skype, Netflix, Napster (!), Vudu, YouTube, and those Yahoo Widgets we saw debut with… was it Samsung, last CES? I think so. They look like regular TVs, so no pictures of them necessary! Besides, LG’s press kit site is being unreliable.</p><p>The Infinia series, basically the top end of the LED line, is led by the LE9500, which goes at a ridiculous 480Hz and is, of course, 1080p. The other two (8500 and 7500) have a piddling 240Hz, and the non-Infinia TVs are a totally unacceptable 120Hz. No matter that a ton of content looks like garbage at those refresh rates, it’s all about the numbers!</p><p>I’m not going to go over every model; they’ve updated the whole line of TVs from 15-inch little guys to 55-inch ultra-lux models.

    "content": "<p>By any measure, Phantom Cyber is a David in a world of security Goliaths. Yet it scored top honors as the Most Innovative Startup of RSA 2016 Innovation Sandbox contest. It has raised less money than most of other contenders. Yet it’s offerings were seen as novel, even ground breaking.</p><p>At a standing room only event at Moscone North, 10 startups pitched. Each had precisely 3 minutes, and a nerve-jangling buzzer cut them off if they exceeded the time.</p><p>The judging panel of Asheem Chandna, a partner at Greylock; Patrick Heim, who serves as the Head of Trust at Dropbox; Gerhard Eschelbeck, a VP of Security at Google; Renee Gutman, the CISO at Royal Caribbean; and Paul Kocher, who serves as the President of Crypto Research at Rambus had seen it all. Their role was to shred some of these pitches apart – gently & one at a time. With one presenter, the judges even asked if the markets care about the companies offering. But not for Phantom.</p><p>According to 451 Research, over 100 new security startups are formed each year. Add that to ~1300 existing security vendors that are shouting each other out in the marketplace. What you have is a lot of noise, confusion and me-toos.</p><p>As Brendon Daly of 451 Research says, security is the only sector where both fear and greed are at play at the same time. Classical ROI driven sales exercises greed by driving even more greed – of higher revenues. Security vendors often exercise their greed by fostering a reign of fear, not unlike an arms vendor. And no arms vendor prays for world peace.</p><p>The vendor driven FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) fatigue leads to a chain of mistrust and short-term madness. Rumors that CISOs have even hired post-breach fall guys are prevalent.</p><p>Large enterprises often deal with as many as fifty security products. Getting them to integrate / interoperate with each other so that the CISO can see the big picture is a nightmare.</p><p>In such a messy gold-rush, Phantom’s platform acts as a layer of connective tissue to the industry, simplifying and automating the life of security teams. Phantom Apps can perform 120 different actions across forty disparate technologies allowing investigation, hunting and containment. Its philosophical approach is fresh – to let the security community share playbooks via its Github repositories making its platform open and extendable. With both northbound and southbound API integration, investigation and containment can become much faster.</p><p>Why does the world care about automation</p><p>Patrick Heim, Head of Trust at Dropbox was one of the judges at RSA Sandbox 2016. He points out that there are three challenges that make security automation appealing:</p><p>* A shortage of highly skilled security professionals requires that we make them as efficient as possible.</p><p>* With manual process, the time between a detection event and a response event can be too long to prevent a significant loss.</p><p>* A best of breed strategy involving numerous vendors is required to defend against agile threats.</p><p>“Security automation appeals to all three of these constraints by integrating diverse products, reducing detection-to-response time, and raising the productivity of skilled security engineers” he says.</p><p>According to Oliver Friedrichs, CEO of Phantom, over 75% of security teams suffer from alert fatigue and routinely ignore alerts. In a 7 step automated process, he demonstrates how Phantom can auto-magically contain malware.</p><p>“With numerous security analytics providers, we have a lot more data but that has created a new bottleneck. Analysts are on a hamster wheel, trying to keep up and the action loop is needed” says Friedrichs.  If you look at how the NSA moved from addressing 65 events a day to tens of thousands a day, the value proposition starts to become much clearer.</p><p>As a part of Active Cyber Defense Initiative at John H Hopkins University, Phantom worked with various federal agencies for over 11 months and contributed towards development of Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense technologies.</p><p>For Friedrichs, who practised his Sandbox pitch over 50 times to perfect the 3 minute pitch, he has seen it all before. This is his fourth startup, with three previous security companies having been acquired by the likes of McAfee, Symantec and Sourcefire.</p><p>His innovations in advanced malware at Immunet (acquired by Sourcefire, which in turn, got acquired by Cisco) have now reached over 10,000 companies. Phantom’s team has grown to 20 people and Friedrichs gives much credit to his co-founder Sourabh Satish and team for getting Phantom ready over the past two years.</p><p>Now, the challenge is to make sure Phantom itself does not become compromised. As risk gets centralized, security platforms need to ensure robustness and build layers of protection. “We have hardened the OS, added two factor authentication with multiple approval layers, encrypted stored credentials and routinely use outside firms to conduct pentesting,” says Friedrichs.</p><p>Phantom’s goals to automate the enterprise SOC (Security Operation Center) is a start. “We are creating a new category of connective security software and are ambitions of building a scalable company” he adds.</p><p>“The competition for us is an engineer writing Python scripts to do this internally” says Friedrichs. Validating the opportunity is Fireeye’s recent acquisition of Invotas. This opens up the playground for Phantom. In a 451 Research Survey  of 803 survey respondents, majority believed that culling of the vendor pool is bound to occur. This may bode well for Phantom.</p><p>One of the early investors in Phantom, Jay Leek, CISO of Blackstone says “Phantom is the first-mover in the automates the workflow from alerts to investigation and remediation. Such automation can empower one FTE (Full Time Equivalent) to do as much as five FTEs once deployed at scale. We can now drive consistency across operational functions by eliminating human errors. We can isolate a computer with one click, or a “kill switch”, if destructive malwar</p>",

    "content": "<p>Measuring the success of your app via the number of monthly active users is dubious at best. The metric may have become the standard but, when it comes to daily use apps such as messaging services or social networks, the data point becomes all the less illustrative.</p><p>As I pointed out last year, humans are social beings and we generally communicate with friends, family and loved ones on a daily basis. If I’m just opening your chat app once a month or once a week, you don’t have the right to label me an “active” user. Doing so is lazy at best or deliberately misleading at worst.</p><p>These habits take time to shift, of course. To date, the industry has stuck with its fuzzy data point: Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, Line and even Snapchat (internal data only) are among the many that convey their traction by listing how many people have opened their app at least one time per month.</p><p>They also track messages sent and received (which are crucially not the same due to groups), messaging frequency and other large numbers that don’t really provide much context into how apps are actually being used. Even time spent inside an app is misleading considering chat apps are typically used alongside other apps as users multitask on the device.</p><p>One chat app firm that is trying to change the status quo is Kik. The Canada-based company, which was recently backed by China’s Tencent at a valuation of over $1 billion, has adopted a more qualitative approach to measuring engagement.</p><p>* Active: when a user replies to a chat messaging within 20 seconds</p><p>* Passive: when a user replies to a chat messaging in two to three minutes</p><p>* Sporadic: when a user replies to chat messaging over longer periods during the day</p><p>Kik, which only provides total registered user numbers (now 300 million), is squarely focused on the U. S. youth market — it claims that 40 percent of U.S. teens use its iOS or Android app. With a focus on a particular group not a mass audience, it is perhaps unsurprisingly that it is pushing this kind of measurement.</p><p>“As we have seen chat behaviors evolve, at Kik we’ve become less interested in how many messages are exchanged or how many times an app is opened, and more interested in how people engage in chatting. Put more simply: we care more about attention than app taps,” Kik CEO Ted Livingston (pictured above) explained in a Medium post.</p><p>Within this measurement structure, Kik put out a few interesting snippets about its young userbase:</p><p>* The average U.S. teen on Kik engages in 6.1 chats a day, averaging 12.7 minutes per session</p><p>* U.S. teen females on Kik chat 35 percent longer than their male equivalents</p><p>* U.S. teen “super users” — who Kik says make up 10 percent of its userbase — engage in 10 chats per day with an average of 157 minute per day</p><p>* Kik users are more engaged in active chat mode during the week, but they have more chat sessions during the weekend</p><p>* Overall, Kik users spend about 21 percent of their time in an active chat state and 79 percent in passive state</p><p>To really benefit from these new metrics it would be useful if Kik did share common industry metrics — that would help emphasize the relevancy of its new metrics — but don’t expect that to happen any time soon… well, actually, ever.</p><p>“Existing metrics tend to favor feed-based consumption rather than chat,” Joel Cumming, Kik’s head of data, told TechCrunch in an interview. “Everyone can make up their own rules for [measuring monthly active users] — we could’ve gone down that route but didn’t. The U. S. teen market is not 600 million users in size so we prefer to focus on engagement.”</p><p>Of course, going public with MAUs would also make Kik look a lot smaller than the competition. Facebook Messenger and Facebook-owned WhatsApp both claim over one billion active users, Line has 212 million, WeChat has over 697 million, and Snapchat has — according to leaked data — over 100 million daily users.</p><p>Nonetheless, as someone who had to deal with companies peddling bullsh*t user data for far too long, I applaud the qualitative focus. Sadly, I doubt others in the industry will follow Kik’s lead.</p>",

    "content": "<p>During an afternoon call with me, Airmada CEO Dan Danay, the ex-Israeli Naval Officer and Sloan School of Business grad, outlined his autonomous drone product offering. As he and co-founder Boris Lipchin are preparing for Y Combinator Demo Day next week, the YC winter class of ’16 member told me “Drones are hard to use but they have potential, so we want to remove cost and friction from commercial use of drones.”</p><p>There are many problems that are currently holding back commercial use of drones. You have to know how to fly them or set up autonomous flight. You have to transport them to the right location where they are needed. You need qualified inspection and maintenance.</p><p>Despite these barriers, there are many companies still in need of drones for everything from precision agriculture, to aerial photography to small maritime deliveries.</p><p>Danay and Lipchin are aiming at all of these categories with their offering, however maritime deliveries are especially ripe for disruption, according to the duo.</p><p>The problem (one that Danay has witnessed himself as a naval officer) is that ships near port are in constant need of  supplies, large and small. However the price of delivering small goods—medical supplies, navigation charts, sim cards, fuel samples—costs the same as delivering large goods like steel or machinery.</p><p>This is because the deployment of a launch boat to deliver the goods is the same whether the items are large or small and that cost gets passed on to the customer. At a place like the Panama Canal, it can cost a minimum of $600 for a single delivery, regardless of size, and can get as high as $3000 depending on timing and traffic.</p><p>Their solution is to use small drones to deliver small things at a fraction of the cost and let the launch boats continue to deliver larger items.</p><p>To avoid the previously mentioned problems holding drones back from commercial use, Airmada have developed an enclosed, automated drone terminal. This terminal contains everything needed to automatically launch, maintain, recharge, inspect and protect drones used for delivery, photography or other drone-assigned tasks.</p><p>For delivery agents who are interested in beginning to deliver maritime supplies or conduct aerial photography for clients, an Airmada drone terminal can be delivered to their location and requires little interaction on their part.</p><p>When a delivery needs to be made, or when photographs or video need captured, the terminal opens up, the drone flies out on a GPS-informed programmed path, delivers the goods or conducts video capture, returns to the terminal, lands inside and machinery inside automatically replaces batteries from an array in side, it is inspected and is ready for its next task.</p><p>It sounds like something from The Jetsons.</p><p>Danay explained to me that for one-off maritime parcel deliveries, the drones can drop the items from two meters—even for moving boats. For larger craft that may require many deliveries, a second terminal can be installed for more routine landings.</p><p>Danay further explained that Airmada can enter the market at half the cost of local launch boats—around $300 per delivery and in about a tenth of the time.</p><p>The team have already beta tested in Panama, Estonia and Iceland and have agent delivery signups already taking place in Panama.</p><p>According to Danay, they hope to make the days of hauling small parcel deliveries up the side of a ship in a bucket tied to a rope (something he personally witnessed many times), a thing of the past.</p><p>More info at airmada.com.

    "content": "<p>It wasn’t easy accumulating the research data displayed in the following guide. I saw horrific sights working retail for seven long years in both a big box electronic store and a major shopping center. I saw things that will haunt me the rest of my days. I watched two kids get trampled by what I call Double-Wides because Circuit City clearanced-out Dreamcasts for $80 on Black Friday. I once hid behind a massive video display just for a few moments during the chaos. I’ve seen people fight, bite, and trample other members of our human race just to save a few dollars.</p><p>What follows is perhaps the most comprehensive Black Friday guide ever assembled. There are shopping tactics, buying guides, survival tips, and a thorough rundown of the different types of Black Friday shoppers you will encounter. Please, if you’re considering shopping on Black Friday, think about your family, your dog, your livelihood and reconsider. If you’re still convinced that it’s the right thing to do, be sure to thoroughly read The Black Friday Survival Guide. Your life literally depends on it.</p><p>This type of Black Friday shopper is becoming more and more common, almost as if there’s an epidemic sweeping the nation causing more of these types. These shoppers are nearly impossible to avoid, so use their sheer size for your own gain. Think more NASCAR than football. You’re going to draft behind of them as they plow through Smokers and Big Papis (see below). Once the target is within sight, a quick bump should cause them to stumble just long enough for you to shoot ahead and snatch the last Kinect holiday bundle before they can get their sausage fingers on it — just watch out for a Big Papi if you perform this maneuver. A simple “Look, it’s cheaper on that endcap.” might be all it takes for a half-second distraction.</p><p>Smokers are generally of the female orientation, but don’t be surprised to see some from the male gender either. This shopper generally spends 3AM to 4AM clam baking in their minivan, with the primary goal of creating a vile personal safety bubble that most will not dare enter. Be careful, these are wiry folks; hunched over from years of smoking three packs a day, they come prepped for Black Friday with at least one whole pot of Folgers Coffee in their gut. While they may be quick off the line, they also get winded quickly. It’s best to give them plenty of room to run with the goal of outlasting them.</p><p>* Primary Attack: The vile smell of loosies seeping from their pores</p><p>Big Papis generally sport either NFL jerseys or Real Tree hunting appeal. Both make them easy to spot. The best course of action is to simply avoid these beasts at all cost. They might seem mild-mannered from a distance, but they generally accompany a Double-Wide during her hunting spree and will protect their property at all costs. If you topple a Double-Wide, duck into the crowd immediately, because a Big Papi would like nothing more than to justify getting up at 3AM by making the local news after pounding your face.</p><p>These dudes might also be shopping by themselves; this is where the NFL jerseys and camo come into play. It’s their way of maintaining a bit of manhood while participating in a generally female ritual. If spotted alone, use the same tactics for the Double-Wides as they are generally in the same mental state.</p><p>* Strengths: Height, longer arms, the natural ability to be a hunter</p><p>This is by far the most deadly of all Black Friday shoppers. A Mothership’s primary goal is to hit multiple stores one after another by utilizing her teenage offspring and friends. These children will do anything to impress their mother and their small frame makes them perfect for ducking and diving through crowds while the Mothership waits outside the stores front door with the engine running. The teenagers are fine shoppers, it’s the Mothership that will kill wondering Old Timers when traveling between stores. She’ll peel out from a store with her eyes buried in her bags, inspecting each one to ensure the entire list was purchased. Scary stuff.</p><p>These folks are more cute than they are dangerous. Old Timers can be either male or female; it doesn’t matter. Their Members Only jackets or London Fog overcoats generally give them away. The male Old Timers are generally found with their hands in their pockets, waiting patiently by the front door for their female counterpart. Women Old Timers might put up an angry front, but most of the time they’ll unknowingly handover a doorbuster to a teary-eyed Mothership offspring. Do the right thing, and side with the Old Timer.</p><p>* Primary Attack: The old lady look</p><p>Black Friday is serious business; potential for danger is very real. Please, always travel in packs of two. You’ll have each others backs. Double-Wides tend to rush product displays like $7.99 food buffets, but remember, a nonchalant shove in their upper half will likely cause them to lose balance and could save the life of your partner — or at least net you the last half-priced Hannah Montana Dream Star Acoustic guitar.</p><p>Another potentially risky maneuver: the “Blind Checkout”. This calls for sending one shopper into the fray while another immediately gets in line upon entering a store. It’s best performed if you’re getting to a store shortly after the doors open. Rude Smokers will generally cause a stink if this is noticed, but a person waiting in line can counter this by grabbing a random product to hold while waiting. Simply give this unwanted item to the clerk while checking out. Your timing needs to be spot-on though. If the line waiter gets in line too early, they’ll be left awkwardly empty-handed if the shopper doesn’t return with the items quickly. (Pro-tip: if you’re next in line and product-less, pretend to answer an important phone call, step out of line, and just jump right back to the end 30 seconds later.)</p><p>Watches need to be synced and there should always be an open line of communication. Get Bluetooth headsets, learn how to use the conferen</p>",

Richardson calls it the Raspberry Pi Dynamic Headlight, and it’s one of those jaw-dropping DIY projects that makes you wonder why this isn’t something you can buy in a store yet.</p><p>The prototype has a small projector mounted to the handlebars of the bicycle, which is connected to the Raspberry Pi via HDMI cable. The projector and the Raspberry Pi are both powered by a USB battery pack. The Raspberry Pi and the battery pack seem to be crudely glued to a triangular piece of wood that is strapped onto the center of the bike, but Richardson says in his video that he’s hoping that future prototypes will combine all the components into one single piece that will be mounted onto the handlebars.</p><p>The Dynamic Headlight for now only projects the speed of the bike, but Richardson is looking to add all sorts of interesting functions to future iterations like GPS and other “animations and visualizations”.

    "content": "<p>In the world of tech and investing FOMO is a dominant theme that drives much of investment decision-making at the early stage. Ben Lerer, Managing Partner at Lerer Hippeau Ventures, goes as far as stating, “FOMO is an inevitable part of life as an investor,” in our latest interview. However, there are methods and processes that can be used to mitigate the effects of FOMO.</p><p>1. Recognition Is The First Step To Recovery</p><p>Similar to that of an addiction, the acceptance of the presence of FOMO is the crucial first step. As Lerer states, ‘being aware of it is how you do not fall victim to it.” So with every prospective investment, sit back and appreciate the power of FOMO. This will be your first step to managing it.</p><p>A fundamental element of the investment decision making process for investors it to look at their potential co-investors on an opportunity. As Jessica Livingstone at Y Combinator suggests, ‘they want to invest only if other people are investing.’ This herd mentality acts to reduce the potential social denunciation if the deal does not work. Lerer deliberately attempts to avoid this by not looking at the cap table of co-investors. As Lerer stated in our interview, “the less I know the better.” This decision making isolation allows the investor to view the investment in it’s purest form, without societal biases.</p><p>The speed of your investment decision making can largely mitigate the effects of FOMO. Investors fall prey to characteristics of FOMO when they deliberate for a long time and then look to external factors other than the company, on whether to invest. These could be co-investors, macro-economic cycles, market predictions etc. So the power of thinking fast, not slow, is crucial. Be decisive, act with conviction, based on the product and team alone.</p><p>Ultimately, FOMO is an immortal element of early stage investing. However, the ability to accept it, focus on the product and company alone and then act with speed, will stand you in good stead to remain FOMO free! But always remember Lerer’s words, “the day you no longer are scared of FOMO, is the day you succumb to it.”</p>",

S., even though the company has flown low on Silicon Valley’s radar and raised just $25 million. And while there’s been plenty of hype around Snapchat ads — which rolled out last month and were first revealed by CEO Evan Spiegel at a high profile Vanity Fair event — Kik Promoted Chats was quietly introduced in the summer in beta.</p><p>The new Kik feature is simple. A range of companies take up official accounts on the service — Kik says there are initially 25 across fashion, retail, non-profit and more — which can be used to converse with users who opt in to follow them. Replying to large numbers of people manually isn’t possible, so Kik has introduced ‘Keywords’, a feature that lets brand accounts create stock responses based on ‘trigger’ words in chats from users following them.</p><p>The idea is that brands have interesting things to say and share so, rather than generic ads for everyone, Kik users can pick which companies that they want to hear from. Or just opt out altogether. Using the right messages, the idea is that Kik accounts can be used to direct users to offers, promotions, new content or feedback.</p><p>Take for example this series of chats from frozen yogurt chain 16 Handles.</p><p>Brands are encouraged to incorporate Kik into their existing social strategy and promote their handle offline, though Kik will also surface their account to users via the ‘Promoted’ tab. That sits next to the main chat button so is frequently visited by Kik users.</p><p>Operating an account and using keywords is free. Kik hopes to monetize the service via the promotion feature, which lets brands set their target audience using location and via a real-time bidding facility that operates like standard online ad portals.</p><p>To date, Kik has only made (a little) money by selling stickers, although its recently introduced the Kik Points system — which rewards users for carrying out specified tasks — could probably be tweaked into a money maker.</p><p>Likewise its HTML5-based cards system — which allows any website to run inside the integrated web browser inside Kik and be easily shared with a friend — could be configured so that brands pay to make their Kik-optimized websites visible to users.</p><p>But, for now, this is the most significant revenue move that the company has made.</p><p>“These additions are the next evolution in how Kik can build services for users and monetize our app,” Paul Gray, product strategist at Kik, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p><p>Gray added that 6.5 million users chatted with branded accounts during the trial, and during the test period over 100 million messages were exchanged.</p><p>Unlike advertising — which is never enjoyable, even when done well — Kik’s approach can be beneficial to users, in a way not dissimilar to how Asia’s top chat apps have integrated opt-in marketing and promotions to their platforms.</p><p>“When people talk to these accounts it’s a useful experience for users,” Gray said. While for brands: “Kik will be complementary to Facebook and other social channels. Kik users get native [push] notifications [on their phone] for new messages, which makes them highly likely to read — unlike messages pushed out on broadcast social networks, which just have some chance of being seen.”</p><p>This feature seems like another thoughtful addition from Kik, which has made some unexpected moves — including the integration of a web browser into its chat app. Gray says the Canadian startup is talking to a range of major brands already about coming onboard, and he believes that those with an interest in young audiences in North America are ideal fits.</p><p>When contacted for thoughts on the potential of Kik Promoted Chat in the communications mix, Sean O’Neal — President at marketing firm Adaptly — told TechCrunch via email:</p><p>Mobile messaging apps like Kik represent the next wave of global audience platforms. There is significant scale, with hundreds of millions of users on the larger platforms. But more importantly, they offer a new and more intimate form of brand engagement. The ability for a brand to interact with their audience on a one-to-one basis provides for more meaningful connections. This form of “conversational engagement” has a unique place in our marketing plans and compliments the opportunities across the media mix.</p><p>Those who doubt Kik’s significance in the U. S., or perhaps haven’t heard of the app, may be surprised to hear that half of its registered users send content of some form on the service each day. Kik also says that 68% of its users are based in the US — that, it claims, means around 40% of Americans aged 13-25 use the service.</p><p>At at a time of seemingly never-ending speculation that Facebook is losing popularity among young Americans, it’s not hard to see how Kik and Snapchat are attractive to brands, particularly given that messaging is a hot topic this year.</p>",

Today Messenger users on iOS and Android in the US get two new features which could roll out to other countries if they test well.</p><p>Facebook tells me “We look at this chat assist function with polls and payments as just another example of offering help to make Messenger users lives easier – like offering a ride with Uber, for example.”</p><p>Polls lets you write a question and some possible answers, send them to everyone in a group chat, and then see what’s most popular so you can make plans together.</p><p>It’s essentially Facebook’s original Polls feature from 2007, which was later scrapped. It’s also reminiscent of the Facebook Questions feature, which launched in 2010 as a Quora-like Q&A option for News Feed sharing, but then aligned with my recommendation to pivot towards lightweight polling in 2011. Facebook scaled the feature back to only appear in Events and Groups. Now it’s coming to chat, accessible from the message options bar above the composer, or inside the More drawer.</p><p>Facebook writes that it could help “get groups of people to make decisions and plans [such as] which day to meet up for coffee, where to go on the next family vacation, and much more.” Other apps like Twitter, Google+, and Tinder’s new Stacks iMessage app also offer polling features. But by building it into a 1 billion user chat app where people already organize get-togethers and ask opinions of friends, Messenger Polls could fit naturally in our lives.</p><p>Messenger’s new “chat assist” feature for payments uses machine learning to scan the text you and your friends write, looking for indicators that someone should be sent money. Phrases like “IOU”, or possibly “You owe me $10” or “Send me $18 for dinner” will trigger Messenger to insert a payment button like “Pay $18” below the message.</p><p>Friends can then decide whether to click and quickly send money from a debit card number you enter or have previously connected to Messenger.</p><p>Facebook first launched friend-to-friend payments in March 2015, and just opened up payments to chatbots. But now you won’t have to beg and nag people as directly to settle their debts. Facebook’s AI will swoop in. Facebook already has some know-how here since the head of Messenger David Marcus and its VP of Product Stan Chudnovsky both came from PayPal.</p><p>Making payments a seamless part of the conversation experience could lure people away from siloed apps like Venmo, PayPal, and Square Cash which solely handle payments and not everyone has. Combining Messenger’s ubiquity with a simple payments feature could keep people running all their communication, words or dollars, through Facebook’s chat app.</p>",

But the 8-bit look of the game, paired with its faithful recreation of the scenes and, as Kotaku notes, set dressing of Serena Williams’ past 22 victories at major international pro tennis tournaments, definitely make it a worthwhile distraction.</p><p>The game is available in Snapchat’s ESPN Discover channel, as mentioned, but it’s also available on the web courtesy of Gatorade if you’re an old or otherwise unwilling to locate it in the Snapchativerse. The graphics, soundtrack and simple but effective control scheme, paired with how simple it is to learn, mean you’ll probably get all the way through Serena’s 22 victories in a relatively short time.</p><p>For Snapchat as a platform, it’s a demonstration of something it can offer that isn’t necessarily available in other social vectors – a different, more engaging kind of interaction model integrated right into the stream of multimedia content brands are delivering using things like Stories and Discover. And it’s proof that game developers might be able to do something interesting within Snapchat itself as a platform (you could easily see recent hit Reign replicated using similar tools within Snapchat itself, for instance).</p><p>Whatever it does or doesn’t lead to, it’s an interesting experiment that definitely stands out among brand advertisements, and a sign that Snapchat is thinking differently about how it might engage both business and end users in that regard.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Billionaire CEO Yueting Jia told employees in a letter last week that the company’s rapid growth was leading to stagnation and management problems at LeEco, and announced that he would invest $10 million into the company and cut his salary to 15 cents in order to keep LeEco steady as it expands into the United States and develops a self-driving car.</p><p>But North American operations lead Brian Hui told the audience at TechCrunch Beijing today that things aren’t as dire as the letter made them seem. “If you read the letter, it’s not about whether it’s sustainable or not sustainable,” Hui said of LeEco’s growth. “It’s not about running out of money. It’s how you can spend your money wisely… You go through a very aggressive user base growth period before you enter a financially sustainable period. I think this is pretty normal, applying to any kind of startup.”</p><p>Although the letter led to rumors that LeEco would abandon the development of a self-driving vehicle, Hui said that work on the car was a “highest priority” and would continue. Hui said that he does not anticipate layoffs on the U. S. team, which has grown from 30 to nearly 600 over the course of the year. The U.S. staff of LeEco is primarily focused on research and development for smart devices and internet ecosystems, he said.</p><p>“Fast is not about staffing, it’s more about whether you hire the right people,” Hui said.</p><p>Hui also addressed rumors that suppliers for LeEco’s smartphone business had not been paid, saying that LeEco was not carrying debt to its suppliers. “We will always want to sustain our trust,” he said. “We still maintain a very good relationship with them.” During the U. S. launch of its smartphone two weeks ago, LeEco says all of the phones sold in a little over four hours but declined to say exactly how many units were sold.</p><p>LeEco launched its first products in the U. S. recently in a big international push. And amid all the chatter of growing too fast, that’s raised questions as to whether LeEco’s move to launch in the U.S. market was the right one. Still despite this, Hui said the company — as it moves on to what he called “phase 2” — was trying to focus on building a more healthy financial operation. So, to that extent, it would seem from Hui that U.S. expansion was already baked into those expectations.</p><p>That launch was accompanied with a massive splashy event in the hopes of placing an exclamation point on the company’s entry into the U. S. Gunning for that kind of publicity, it would seem that the company had very high ambitions for its international expansion. That made the letter sent by Jia to lead to even more scrutiny for the company, given that it hoped to heavily invest in its expansion into highly-competitive markets.</p><p>For the U. S., it isn’t just about phones and TVs, Hui said. The company is hoping to replicate all of what Hui said were its successes in China. That includes not only its hardware operations, but also content and other ecosystems. Hui said that “smart devices” would be the company’s entry point into the U.S. It’s still going to be an uphill battle across the board, but LeEco is hoping to somehow couple the experiences together using online services, Hui said.</p><p>“When I was a kid, I used [the Sony] Walkman, but all [Sony’s devices] are silo’d,” Hui said. “If you ambition to have other disruptive services, you want to provide the best service to your customer. And to add value to the customer, you need to have something that couples the entire experience. That’s Internet and cloud.”</p><p>Jia said in his letter that he would require management to meet a “higher bar” and encourage more collaboration between LeEco’s disparate product teams. “This is the most difficult year in LeEco’s history,” he wrote. “Rumors plunged us into the abyss of hardship and adversity with the stock price of Letv.com falling to rock bottom.”</p><p>Despite Hui’s optimism, there was a lot to unpack in that letter. And it placed a cloud of uncertainty around the company, which Hui tried to clear out.</p><p>“I think the most important thing is about not just the letter but the substance in the letter,” he said. “How sincere, how honest, is this company of the thing we are trying to build globally. Between the choices of hiding things, we generally share the challenge we are facing today. The consistent message of the ecosystem we are trying to build, I hope and I believe that if the crowd here or the users pay attention to LeEco, and the users who are using our products and services, you will share and believe that the ecosytem we are trying to build is not just for now but for the future.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>While faulty hoverboards are setting themselves ablaze to celebrate Christmas, robots are gradually moving from labs to news reports to entering our daily lives.</p><p>First in line are drones, already in many people’s hands, autonomous cars with early deployments such as Tesla’s autopilot, and desktop robots like 3d printers.</p><p>In 2015 robot popped up in many forms, shapes and industries. Investments in robotics keep growing (about $340M in 2014) as well as the number of robotics startups. They represented a third of HAX new investments in 2015.</p><p>Now let’s review the state of robotics.</p><p>Like all connected devices they are benefitting from the massive drop in price and size of sensors and CPU ushered by the boom of smartphones and advanced game consoles. Robotics companies can certainly thank Apple, Nintendo and Microsoft! They can also thank the now defunct startup Willow Garage for initiating the ROS robot OS project.</p><p>More projects and available early stage capital means that many startups can build prototypes. Things get difficult with the next phase as most professional money waits for revenue to fuel growth. Still, a number of startups access significant funding. Large players such as Google, Amazon, Tesla, Apple and Uber are investing in or acquiring various companies, talent and technologies.</p><p>It is not easy to come up with a definition that could satisfy professionals and the general public, who uses the term liberally. To simplify, a robot is a device that adapts to its environment thanks to autonomous movement and takes autonomous decisions. This definition does not include machines that just execute a repetitive task, or require full remote control. Hence, most toy drones, 3d printers and a large number of factory arms would not qualify, though many would call them robots. Those are, however, evolving toward more intelligence with computer vision and more, and crawling toward a proper “robot” status.</p><p>Classifying robots is another tough one. It could be done according to technology or application. We decided to group them the following way:</p><p>Drones are receiving vast amounts of attention and funding. DJI, 3DR, Parrot and a few upstarts like eHang and Yuneec secured 8-digit investments (and China is rising as a drone powerhouse). GoPro announced its entry for 2016. Applications are evolving from imagery, surveying and surveillance toward deliveries (Amazon Prime Air, Alibaba, but also delivery companies such as SF Express in China), inspection and even first-person-view (FPV) racing. Key players have formed the Small UAV Coalition to inform policy makers and promote safety.</p><p>Service robots is one of the most exciting categories. According to M. A. Shah, co-founder of the retail robotics startup Simbe Robotics“Autonomous ground service robots today have the same kind of momentum that drones enjoyed 2-3 years back”.</p><p>Among them are warehouse robots – Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics), GreyOrange, Fetch Robotics, inVia – and others in sectors as varied as hospitality, surveillance, customer service, retail inventory, demolition, commercial cleaning, ground delivery, cleaning windows or your aquarium, painting, watching forests for fires, bartending and more.</p><p>Lifestyle robots: autonomous vacuum cleaners and lawnmowers are now widespread and commoditizing fast. New products such as Nua’s following suitcase are getting use closer to a Jestons lifestyle.</p><p>Social robots: they are the wild card of the new generation. From Softbank’s Pepper to MIT grad Jibo, or France’s Keecker and Buddy, it is hard to tell if this will catch on.</p><p>Cobots: those collaborative robots are a promising branch of robotics, with companies like Rethink Robotics, Universal Robots, Kawada Industries or the large ABB. Working alongside humans, they could become extremely useful when they become trainable by non-experts and once prices drop.</p><p>Other robots: in here we have the DARPA-funded projects Google acquired with Boston Dynamics, as well as agribots, biomimetic,reconfigurable, modular and soft robots (the latter two, observed at MIT and Carnegie Mellon, inspired the robots in Big Hero 6).</p><p>We added here some innovative grippers like Empire Robotics’s Versaball and Festo’s FinGripper since it is sometimes said “a robot is just as good as its grippers”.</p><p>2016 & Beyond</p><p>Will 2016 have a “Macintosh moment” for robotics? The lower price of components and increasing number of plug & play hardware and software will help. Yet, there are barriers beyond economics and components:</p><p>– First, robots are still quite dumb</p><p>As mentioned by Dan Corkum, co-founder of Carbon Robotics: “Better & cheaper chips are needed for path planning, inverse kinematics, image processing, object and face recognition, or collaborative automation.” Quality robots would require cheaper CPUs, better algorithms and interfaces, improved actuators and… better safety: a robot that can do something your really want can also do something you really don’t want.</p><p>– Second, funding is lacking</p><p>There is a low number of investors keen on financing robotics startups at early stages. Robotics is often a sub-category of hardware, itself a small minority of the pitches VC see (robotics were barely 0.7% of VC investment in 2014). Building enough expertise to confidently invest before there are solid numbers requires a dedicated focus.</p><p>– Third, robotics talent is lacking</p><p>Funded startups often resort to in-house training. Some others like Google and Tesla resort to more aggressive tactics like poaching from competitors, or university labs.</p>",

That was not a no,” he eventually said.</p><p>Though Hastings was coy about any potential acquisition of a major content provider he might be interested in he was not shy about mentioning some of the original content Netflix is now producing.</p><p>The company has shared original content for a while now via House of Cards, Narcos and others but it debuted its first big, in-house production, Stranger Things, this summer — and that approach is the way of the future for Hastings and his entertainment platform.</p><p>“We’re going to evolve past just the Hollywood enclave and really try to unleash the world’s great, high-end creators,” he said.</p><p>Netflix, now in 130 countries running on more than 600 ISP’s, takes that goal region-by-region and Hastings seems practical about how to reach different consumers in different areas, but he says he has a long way to go to capturing attention away from all the apps and social media networks and all the other things that take away from giving Netflix our attention.</p><p>The real challenge, he says, is figuring out what the next thing is to capture that attention, “Is it VR, is it gaming, is it pharmacological?” he said.</p><p>Hastings then entertained a weirdly off-script and hilarious projection about that last part, “In twenty or fifty years taking a personalized blue pill, you just hallucinate in an entertaining way and then a white pill brings you back to normality is perfectly viable; and if the source of human entertainment in thirty or forty years is pharmacological we’ll be in real trouble,” he said.</p><p>But, getting back on track, Hastings was hopeful AT&T might throw in some money in the future to make some of those original shows Netflix is famous for, right alongside competitors like Hulu, Amazon and his company.</p><p>Overall, Hastings believes he’s in the business of “turning money into joy” and “eliminating boredom and loneliness” more than anything.</p><p>AT&T and others who want to own original content, not just control the pipe see the advantage in that — Netflix just posted a juicy quarter, adding 3.2 million subscribers, with expectations to grow subscribers — and revenue — even more this holiday season.</p>",

We said: ‘Why not for the U.S.?’ ”</p><p>Ushahidi’s interactive U.

It was originally developed as an open source crowdsource app in response to Kenya’s 2007-08 election violence and quickly gained global recognition as a highly effective tool for digitally mapping demographic events anywhere in the world.</p><p>The app’s four original creators — Erik Hersman, Juliana Rotich, Ory Okolloh and David Kobia — founded the Ushahidi international IT company in May 2008. The venture has since received Silicon Valley backing (see TechCrunch’s July Africa roundup) and its software has been deployed 100,000 times in 160 countries.</p><p>Ushahidi will apply the methodologies and expertise gained observing elections around the world in places such as Kenya, South Sudan and Japan to its 2016 USA Election Monitoring campaign. “We’ve designed the platforms and the teams to remove the subjective and review each piece of data objectively before posting,” said Were.</p><p>The legitimacy of the 2016 U. S. presidential election has been called into question through a number of unusual claims from Republican candidate Donald Trump. Chiefly, that the voting system is “rigged” and the American media is colluding to assist his opponent Hillary Clinton. Trump’s backed this up with somewhat unspecific calls for his supporters to “monitor the polls,” which has raised concerns of potential intimidation or even violence at U.S. voting stations.</p><p>So what happens if Ushahidi’s USA Election Monitor campaign tracks significant instances of instability? “We have a methodology to review and escalate to the proper local authorities, be it first responders, election officials, or law enforcement,” said Were.</p>",

Now Google has developed another new service based on its Hangouts infrastructure. It is running a live video chat service for would-be buyers of Google smartphones, tablets and Chromebooks (but not Nest products) to ask Google Device Experts questions and chat about the products before sealing the deal.</p><p>We were tipped off to the service by some of the people working on the project, and Google has confirmed some of the details.</p><p>“We’re always improving features to help our users,” said a spokesperson. “We’re in a limited trial of an experimental support feature and gathering feedback, so we aren’t ready to share full plans yet.”</p><p>Our sources provide some more information. The service, which went live quietly in November, is initially being run as a test through the Devices channel of Google Play, but Google wants to extend the idea to more places, both virtual and physical.</p><p>“They are also planning to go into retail stores with a virtual help desk to enhance the shopping experience,” a source tells us, who described the bigger project as “Google’s virtual Genius Bar,” referring to the Apple Retail in-store operation where Apple employees, lined up behind a bar, offer in-person technical support on Apple devices. It’s not clear yet how far along Google is in implementing this concept of a virtual help desk in retail locations.</p><p>It also bears a resemblance to Amazon’s Mayday service, the company’s tech support system introduced in 2013 that currently works only on Kindle Fire HDX, Kindle Fire HDX 8.9″, Fire HDX 8.9, and Fire Phone devices and in a limited number of countries. Unlike Mayday, Google’s video helper currently does not cover straight tech support.</p><p>The feature for now is only live between 6am and 6pm Pacific time, and to get to it, you navigate through the online Google Play Store to the Devices category. There, you select the help icon in the upper right corner, and if you indicate you are interested in buying a device, you are given the option of making a video call to ask more questions.</p><p>In my test of it, my call was answered within seconds. The smiley woman at the other end of the Hangout knew I was calling from the UK, and was happy to answer all of my questions about Google devices and to show me more details if needed on a second video demonstration screen. Also, she didn’t seem disappointed at all when I told her I wasn’t really buying anything, and was just a journalist trying out the service.</p><p>Google Device Experts is being run within Google but with contractors from an external company called Milestone Technologies. Milestone also partners with Apple, Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and others and provides various services like IT support, contact center services, and professional services.</p><p>Developing a service like this pulls together different businesses and strategies for Google in its move to diversify away from its core business as a search engine. It emphasizes its cloud-based, live video technology. It’s aimed at driving more sales of its hardware. And (potentially) it brings Google deeper into the physical retail commerce. It would be interesting to see if Google, in its growing suite of enterprise services, eventually offers some part of a service like this to other businesses.</p><p>We’ll provide updates on the service as we learn more.</p>",

Google says that its cars have some big advantages over humans when it comes to multi-point turns, like full 360-degree wraparound vision, and extremely accurate distance measurement.</p><p>As a result, Google has found that its cars could actually do maneuvers that don’t resemble the standard three-point turn but that might be more efficient overall – but that’s not ideal UX when it comes to human passengers. Humans are more comfortable when cars drive in ways that include recognizable behavior, so Google has trained its self-driving fleet not only to execute three-point turns, but to do so in a way that “feels natural” to those on board. The Google test cars do around 1,000 multi-point turns on actual city roads per week, Google says.</p><p>Google also uses the report to spell out any accidents its test cars are involved in, and they did have one to report from October 26. The self-driving car was traveling at 3 mph when it was tapped from behind by a vehicle going 6 mph, however, making it a minor fender-bender where the human was at fault and damage was minimal.</p><p>It’s interesting to get a look at how the Google team is building UX into their tech, at the same time as they’re solving difficult technical challenges. Good UX will probably be just as important to long-term user acceptance of autonomous driving tech as will safety issues, so it’s smart to build them hand-in-hand.</p>",

    "content": "<p>If you’ve been paying attention, you probably noticed the recent headlines about T-Mobile CEO John Legere and his anti-EFF mini-rant on Twitter. Legere was responding to a question we had asked about T-Mobile’s Binge On service: “Does Binge On alter the video stream in any way, or just limit its bandwidth?” But it apparently made him angry enough to drop an f-bomb on us.</p><p>He’s since apologized and urged everyone to turn the conversation back to what really matters: user choice and ISP transparency. We are grateful for his apology, and we agree with him. It’s important to focus on the underlying issues instead of being distracted by color commentary. So let’s talk about the issues.</p><p>We want to start by clearly stating our position on Binge On, the carrier’s video-streaming product that lets users stream video without using their data. We think Binge On has great promise. Providing customers a way to control how they use their data is something more ISPs should offer, and in this respect we think Binge On contains the kernel of a good idea.</p><p>The most serious problem with Binge On, as it is now, is that T-Mobile has imposed throttling without its customers’ making an informed choice to participate.</p><p>T-Mobile made Binge On opt-out, which means that, by default, all T-Mobile customers were having all of their video throttled. As we’ve said before, throttling all traffic by default based on application type runs afoul of well-established open Internet principles. Again, we’re not arguing that exchanging throttling for zero-rating isn’t a benefit for some people; we just think people should be able to make that choice themselves, instead of having it thrust upon them.</p><p>Although the option to opt-out constitutes some level of consumer choice, it’s important to recognize that defaults matter, and that a lot of customers (especially less tech-savvy ones) will never even realize that they can change them.</p><p>Additionally, T-Mobile hasn’t been transparent and honest with its users about how Binge On actually works. As a result, the opt-out “choice” customers have been presented with hasn’t been an informed one.</p><p>When it launched Binge On back in November, T-Mobile touted that “Powered by new technology built in to T-Mobile’s network, Binge On optimizes video for mobile screens, minimizing data consumption while still delivering DVD or better quality (e.g. 480p or better).”</p><p>Similarly, on the webpage in which T-Mobile describes how it manages its network, it says that Binge On “uses video streaming optimization…to deliver a DVD quality (typically 480p or better) video experience with minimal buffering while streaming.” And last week, Legere said that “we created adaptive video technology to optimize for mobile screens and stream at a bitrate designed to stretch your data.”</p><p>To anyone from the average user to a Ph. D. in computer science, these descriptions of what Binge On does seem pretty straightforward. When you go to stream a video, T-Mobile’s “video streaming optimization” technology should automatically optimize the video for your mobile screen. Trying to stream an HD (or heaven forbid, a 4K) video to your tiny screen, or download one for watching later? T-Mobile will save you data by ensuring that you actually get a 480p video instead.</p><p>The problem is, that’s not how Binge On actually works. Binge On does not adapt video in any way, shape, or form. It doesn’t optimize video. It doesn’t down-sample video. It doesn’t modify the bitrate of the underlying video stream. It does not automatically transform HD video into 480p video. All Binge On does is cap the bandwidth allocated to the video stream to around 1.5Mbps.</p><p>We call that “throttling.” T-Mobile calls it “downgrading.” (For the record, we think that’s also a misleading term, since downgrading implies video streams are simply being given a lower priority than other traffic. If that were true, then in the absence of higher priority traffic, videos should stream at the same throughput as any other content. But that’s not the case: our tests showed that video streams are capped at around 1.5Mbps even when there’s no congestion.) Whatever you call it, T-Mobile does not actually modify the content of video that enters its network.</p><p>So why does T-Mobile keep insisting that Binge On will result in 480p non-buffering-super-smooth streaming video? Because for some services, it will. Many major streaming video services, from Netflix to YouTube, automatically detect how much bandwidth is available for their video streams to use. They then adapt the quality of the video they send out, so that it streams smoothly. In other words, they detect that T-Mobile is capping the bandwidth, and they optimize the video they send.</p><p>Some (including Legere) have argued that this is just semantics. Video gets adapted one way or another, so what’s the problem?</p><p>The problem is that not all videos adapt automatically by default. Simple embedded HTML5 video, for example, doesn’t have any built-in adaptation capability. When fixed bitrate videos like these hit throttling on T-Mobile’s network, playback will stutter or fail. In order to reach T-Mobile’s customers without playback issues, an independent provider like a journalist, startup or university would need to build or purchase a system to monitor for and adapt to such throttling.</p><p>Additionally, T-Mobile is throttling video downloads, not just streams. So if you’re trying to save a video to watch for later, you’ll eventually get the HD or 4K video file and you’ll use just as much data as you would otherwise, but you’re in for a longer wait than necessary. More than anything, this exposes the fact that T-Mobile’s implementation of Binge On doesn’t actually do any optimization—after all, if it were all about streaming optimization, Binge On wouldn’t touch downloads. It’s not semantics. It’s apples and oranges.</p><p>In order for customers to make informed choices, and in order for websites to be able to reach those customers, th</p>",

    "content": "<p>It’s a Friday night, and I am on the prowl. I’m with my friend Edgar, and we are looking for evidence of the increasing S&M problem among the denizens of America’s startup capital. We all know the story the past few months: it’s really bad right now, but don’t worry, everything will get better in time. But it is not getting better, and it’s time to call out our collective dirty little secret.</p><p>Our Sales and Marketing costs are killing us.</p><p>For years, subscription-based pricing popularized by Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) startups has been pitched to us as a way of reducing S&M costs. Traditionally, software was sold as a license along with a maintenance contract that ensured deep upfront revenues and a continuous stream of income.</p><p>Unlike the complexity of that on-premise implemented and managed software, SaaS was supposed to be simpler for customers to use and pay for. That simplicity not only saves on maintenance costs for overburdened IT departments, but also theoretically lowers the sales touch required for a sale, generating revenue efficiency for the provider. By pricing software as a subscription, startups forego upfront revenue from a license fee in exchange for higher and more reliable renewable revenue.</p><p>It hasn’t worked out that well.</p><p>The evidence is strikingly poor for the subscription model when it comes to actual dollars and cents. My friend and wingman Edgar, the SEC filings database, has all the proof. Just take a look at some of the recent technology IPO filings from the past few months to get a hint of the problem. Hortonworks, the Hadoop provider, filed its S–1 with the SEC last week, and the losses are mounting. The company made $33.4 million in total revenue in the first three quarters of 2014, but its S&M costs were $44.6 million in the same period.</p><p>New Relic, the SaaS application monitoring startup, announced its IPO earlier this month as well, and its earnings record is similar. The company had revenues of $63 million in the year before March 31, with $58 million in sales and marketing costs.</p><p>These high ratios between revenues and sales and marketing expenses are certainly not new for companies heading to the public markets. When I criticized Box and Square back in May, one component of that analysis was the companies’ high costs to sell a product to their customers. Box in particular had $124 million in revenue in the year ending January 31, but $171 million in S&M costs.</p><p>Now, I know the standard excuse here is that these subscription companies are “growing rapidly” and this is all just “an investment in the future.” With subscription pricing, the entire model follows from renewals, with the logic being that once you have acquired a customer, the profit margin will rapidly increase as active sales costs come down.</p><p>The challenge is that low-touch sales never seem to be low cost. If a customer is shelling out a serious amount of money from its IT budget to pay for a service, there is going to have to be constant attention paid to that customer to ensure that they are happy with the service while ensuring that they don’t defect to a competitor. This goes far beyond a support subscription, which handles the day-to-day maintenance of ensuring performance of the service for the customer. The CIO needs to know the provider is listening to their concerns, and that means a sales infrastructure.</p><p>Furthermore, gross margins for SaaS startups in particular are lower than for companies selling traditional software licenses, since these startups don’t just sell code, but also have to manage data centers and other infrastructure to maintain the software service. With less margin, startups should be more efficient with S&M spending.</p><p>But we don’t see companies lowering their S&M costs post-IPO. More than a year after its public debut, FireEye, a security platform for enterprises, had S&M costs that almost equaled revenue in its most recent quarter.</p><p>Even a company as massive as SalesForce has arguably not found its marketing scale yet. In its most recent quarter, SalesForce’s S&M costs represented more than 51% of total revenue, and more than 67% of gross profit. While the company is still expanding at a fast clip with year-over-year revenue growth of 28.5%, it seems hard to see the moment when its S&M costs will simply melt away with renewals continuing.</p><p>This is particularly noticeable when we move away from the SaaS IPOs to other technology startups. OnDeck, the small business lending startup, announced its IPO a few weeks ago, and its operations appear much more reasonable. The company had about $107 million in gross revenue and $48 million in net revenue in the first nine months of this year, with “just” $21.8 million in sales and marketing expenses.</p><p>Does SaaS still offer a compelling model for some startups? Sure, just take a look at Slack. Given its innate virality as a social tool in the workforce, it is entirely credible to believe that the company can have an off-the-shelf product with a subscription pricing model and avoid the S&M problems that plague others in the enterprise space. But it has an advantage with organic growth that few other B2B startups share.</p><p>Frankly, one of the reasons for the popularity of subscription is that founders believe they can simply avoid sales by putting a price matrix online and waiting for customers to come to them.</p><p>It might be time to admit that sales and marketing are crucial to startups from the day they are launched, and find better ways of building up efficient revenues earlier. That message needs to be heard particularly by technical founders, who should grapple and become comfortable hiring sales teams much earlier in their startup’s growth. SaaS is not an excuse to ignore higher-touch sales.</p><p>For in this competitive world, where startups targeting enterprise are competing not just with entrenched players but also other startups, sales matters more than it ever has. The winner of these markets is going to be the company t</p>",

But, make no mistake, it’s all-out war in our Internet-driven and increasingly mobile-first Media 2.0 world of OTT premium video.  And, Netflix is directly in the line of sight and vulnerable both short and long-term.</p><p>AT&T, in the most audacious bid to challenge Netflix to date, just dropped its bombshell $85 billion acquisition of traditional media institution Time Warner. The telecom company ultimately will package and feature Time Warner content (Warner Bros., HBO, Turner) in new ways in its soon-to-launch $35 per month DirecTV Now service that will showcase live linear premium television channels that Netflix doesn’t have.</p><p>AT&T will also exert control over its newly-bought and highly strategic content (assuming the deal closes) to restrict and even withhold that content from others.</p><p>Content is king, after all, and the ever-growing, seemingly endless list of tech-driven OTT distribution platforms increasingly use exclusive premium content as the primary hook to break through the noise and lure us in (and then keep us in, in a world of no long-term contracts and switching costs).  That goes for Netflix itself, which recently announced a goal of 50% of its content consisting of exclusive originals.</p><p>And, that goes for all major behemoths and OTT “wannabes” vying to unseat Netflix — including Hulu, Amazon Video, Verizon go90, YouTube’s “Unplugged” service (reported to launch early 2017), and both Apple’s and Facebook’s inevitable premium OTT video services.</p><p>All of these OTT gorillas (and soon-to-be-gorillas) have ramped up their own exclusives and “Originals” strategies (a la HBO “back in the day”) to beat Netflix at its own exclusive premium programming game.</p><p>And, just like Netflix and the others are DOA without differentiated, compelling premium content, premium content owners desperately need those OTT players to reach their audience at scale, wherever they may be.  And, that audience — particularly the must-have millennials — is increasingly consuming on non-traditional Media 2.0 platforms.</p><p>That presents a fundamental — downright existential — monetization challenge for the major media and entertainment companies.  Hence Time Warner’s sale to AT&T.  And, hence rumors swirling even before the AT&T/Time Warner deal that the most magic content kingdom of them all — Disney — is eyeing Netflix amidst declining ESPN subscriber numbers and now-undeniable cord-cutting (not to mention the rise of an entirely new generation of cord-nevers).</p><p>As active as those rumors were then, they — and other content-driven OTT mega-M&A opportunities — are even riper now that AT&T’s Time Warner gloves are off.  Telcos, and tech titans in general, are increasingly media companies.  And, media companies increasingly need to get technical.  Stakes are massively high.  All eyes — and piles of cash — are focused on this content-driven premium OTT video space.  Right now.</p><p>In Netflix, Disney would get the mother of them all – the largest global OTT video footprint (by an order of a magnitude) and the one premium OTT brand that is universal.  Oh yeah, don’t forget to sprinkle in Netflix’s invaluable data platform (and the smarts to use it) that remain a complete mystery to virtually all traditional media execs.  Even mighty Disney, on its own, can’t build that package.</p><p>And, despite its rosy Q3 numbers, Netflix ultimately needs a buyer.  As I recently wrote, Netflix faces fundamental long-term existential business challenges of its own.  Its singular content-focused subscription-based business model can’t compete with the complex multi-faceted, multi revenue-streamed business models of AT&T, Amazon, YouTube (Google), Verizon, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>And, Netflix’s COGS will only rise significantly as it tries to meet its 50% original content goal amidst competitors who drive up those costs higher, faster (and can use their OTT services as loss leaders).  Netflix conceded as much when it announced its earnings.</p><p>So, Disney and Netflix are logical dance partners.  And, just as we saw with the 50/50 cash and stock financial engineering that enabled AT&T to buy Time Warner, ever-creative Disney undoubtedly has the talent to pull it off.  It also has a market cap that is roughly 3X Netflix’s.</p><p>Here’s one more tantalizing strategic reason for Disney to do the Netflix deal.  Reed Hastings.  Disney CEO Bob Iger is set to retire in 2018 (and already has postponed that move more than once).  So, all eyes in the media and entertainment world closely follow the Happiest-Place-on-Earth’s succession plan.</p><p>It’s no secret that Disney’s board has been in search mode for quite some time, but with no clarity in sight.  Hastings – Media 2.0’s CEO poster child – could step into that role and complete Disney’s Media 2.0 transformation.</p><p>In one fell swoop, Netflix-land would give Disney an undeniable and daunting lead in the OTT video game that signals to the world that it is here to play in the brave new digital world.  Disney’s content library — the envy of the world — would be tough for any competitor (no matter what size) to beat if featured exclusively on a Disney-owned Netflix service.</p><p>And, Disney’s global multi-platform marketing machine is second to none and holds the unique power to promote Netflix’s already near-ubiquitous brand in a borderless world.  In Disney’s hands, Netflix also would demonstrate to both investors and the Street that Disney has the tech-driven DNA necessary to drive the machine and succeed in our new Media 2.0 world.  Enter Reed Hastings, the Mouse House’s new big cheese.</p><p>Yes, Hastings founded Netflix in the tech world of Silicon Valley.  But, let’s not forget that Netflix is no stranger to premium content and the creative process anymore.  It’s Reed Hastings who increasingly holds the Emmys on awards night for Netflix’s own original premium programming slate.  Data-driven </p>",

    "content": "<p>Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp is experimenting with a new Status feature that lets users share mood-setting pictures and videos overlaid with other custom elements such as emoji, with the content disappearing 24 hours after it’s shared — so basically a copy of Snapchat Stories.</p><p>The test feature was spotted on Friday by BGR India which says Status sharing is only currently available to registered public beta testers of WhatsApp who are using a rooted Android or iOS device.</p><p>We’ve reached out to WhatsApp with questions and will update this story with any response.</p><p>In the Android version of the beta the main WhatsApp message screen now has a tab called ‘Status’, sitting between ‘Chats’ on the left and ‘Calls’ on the right. And while it’s always been possible to set a status message in WhatsApp, which is visible when someone views your profile, the new Status tab does not replace that traditional status message; rather it’s a whole additional channel aimed at encouraging users to share ephemeral and primarily visual content with their friends.</p><p>As with Snapchat Stories, once a user has snapped a photo or recorded a video to share within this channel they are offered a range of editing tools to augment the content — such as by drawing on a colorful scribble or adding and positioning emoji. Status also lets users add a caption to further explain whatever they’re posting. A send button shares the Status with the user’s WhatsApp contacts.</p><p>The beta app shares Status content for 24 hours, according to BGR, with no way for users to manually delete a Status after they’ve shared it at this point, nor set a longer (or shorter) lifespan for the content. Users are able to specify which of their contacts can receive Status updates — either by selecting a handful manually or choosing all and excluding a few manually (or indeed selecting all contacts to spam everyone with all Status content).</p><p>Snapchat launched its Stories ephemeral timeline three years ago, and the sharing feature has proved hugely popular — driving massive quantities of daily video views for Snapchat (it reported 10 billion daily video views as of this April). So it’s clear why Facebook is firing up its photocopiers.</p><p>And while it’s taken Zuck & co a while to respond directly to their rival’s ephemeral sharing format, they now seem intent on rolling out a clone of the feature across their social board — with Facebook-owned Instagram launching a near carbon copy feature, Instagram Stories, this summer; and a Stories clone called Messenger Day also being tested on Facebook Messenger this fall.</p><p>In recent times Facebook has been prioritizing video content, as part of a successful push to drive video ad revenue. So getting WhatsApp’s network of one billion+ active monthly users more accustomed to sharing visual content clearly feeds into that play. Especially after the Facebook-owned company announced a huge change to its privacy policy this summer — which implies it will start allowing businesses to show ads to users.</p><p>That’s a massive shift for a company that had, up to then, been firmly against having adverts on its platform. Which just leaves the question of how WhatsApp will integrate ads into its platform without annoying users. And so enter the new Status channel, looking like exactly the sort of conduit where businesses on the WhatsApp platform could start pushing out marketing missives to users who are connected with them.</p>",

These capabilities will allow a more frictionless relationship between us, our objects and environments.</p><p>At the same time, we’re still in the formative stages of the connected era, and companies are trying to understand how to make connectivity meaningful for consumers. As a result, there is a proliferation of early-market products that make consumers question the value of connected products.</p><p>It’s also often articulated that individual gadgets exist somewhat independently, and a major concern for the value these products can bring to our lives lies in the fact that there is no common architecture or platform for developers to build on.</p><p>Studies have also proven that IoT products — wearables in particular — are often abandoned after six months.</p><p>We don’t expect the technology community to arrive at a standard common infrastructure in the coming year, but connectivity does need to evolve to ensure new and existing products stick around in 2015 and beyond.</p><p>Better connecting IoT devices to each other, to their users, and to larger common populations will position them to stay relevant for consumers, which will in turn drive business return for their manufacturers.</p><p>We see four ways connectivity must evolve in 2015.</p><p>Smart IoT companies will build communities — on and offline. Communities provide advice, coaching and ongoing support. Going online to build networks isn’t a new concept, as Facebook has proven for the last decade. Fitness wearable manufacturer Jawbone is exploring the social side of IoT by enabling companies to motivate their employees to be healthier by encouraging tracking results and friendly competition.</p><p>They’re building an in-person network to encourage healthy living — and ongoing use of their product. Growing networks provide fertile ground for ever-increasing real-time collaborations and translations, as well as multi-channel connections.</p><p>Others will form partnerships. This year saw companies like Google realize there was an opportunity in healthcare diagnostics and Fitbit get more fashionable. Partnerships were formed by companies who saw the limit of their expertise and the benefit to acquiring additional capabilities through a development or licensing relationship.</p><p>In 2015, IoT companies will leverage partnerships to access broader networks. New York insurance provider Oscar Health recently partnered with Misfit Wearables, and in January members will be able to connect their fitness trackers to the Oscar Health app and earn Amazon cash when they walk.</p><p>Connected products need to encourage commitment through their design. Fitness trackers, health monitors, and even devices designed to enhance our daily lives (think: Oculus Rift) require some shifts in routine and changes in behavior. When Unilever’s home beauty brand iluminage launched an Internet-connected laser intended to treat facial wrinkles in the home, they purposely leveraged a deliberate physical design. Early consumer research confirmed target users would be comfortable leaving the product on their bathroom counters because of its aesthetic appeal, and this repeated reminder encouraged use.</p><p>It’s also time to start thinking: being connected is not enough. Products will need to get smarter. They will learn and adapt to you. They’ll anticipate your behavior and become the concierge for your life, removing friction in your everyday work and life activities. They’ll be the ones offering advice and support to keep our lives fluid with style and ease. The result will be that content follows context, providing guidance and insight that adapt to our changing needs. Nest and driving mobile app Waze are starting to do this, but rely heavily on user data.</p><p>Connectivity means devices can no longer stand on their own to provide value to their users. As the Internet of Things continues to pervade our lives, smart companies will build connections beyond synching products to databases. They will connect people to each other and will help us all live more seamless, integrated lives.</p>",

Doing so and posting the photo triggers a hashtag to appear inside the tweet, which makes it discoverable to Pepsi — perhaps for further promotion or competitions — and that, in turn, helps promote the brand in a different way on Twitter. That’s the theory, anyway.</p><p>Twitter explained more in a blog post, and with the tweet below:</p><p>Brands can design four or eight stickers — like accessories and other props — for users to add to their own photos. Photos with a brand’s stickers are shared with all of a user’s followers, allowing brands to be featured by their fans in a truly authentic way. #Stickers act as a visual hashtag, meaning that photos with your brand’s sticker will be connected and discoverable to anyone who taps your brand’s sticker. This allows a brand to see and engage with the people who are using their stickers in creative ways.</p><p>This is an interesting move from Twitter designed to help brands do more than just advertise via Promoted Tweets and video units on its service. Last year, the company began letting companies pay for branded emojis — ironically it was Coke, not Pepsi, which was the launch partner for that particular initiative — so expanding into more visual media, such as photos, was to be expected at some point.</p><p>Twitter can take its cues from Snapchat, which has helped feed America’s appetite for stickers and is itself monetizing photos using geo-filters, and Facebook, which has allowed stickers on photos since last year albeit without brand involvement, while further afar Asia-based messaging companies like Line have pioneered stickers are items paid for by both users and brands, too.</p><p>Line, which held a successful IPO this summer, made $270 million from selling stickers last year. While most of that came from users paying a few dollars for a sticker pay, one-third of Line’s $1 billion in revenue came from advertising from official accounts, which use stickers to raise awareness and gain subscribers.</p><p>Twitter is doing things a little differently of course, with its 140-character service. Can brands paying for more subtle visibility help it reach profitability, something the company has yet to achieve?</p>",

    "content": "<p>LeEco is a weird company and the ExploreVR is a weird headset. It’s essentially a Gear VR competitor that promises to deliver a low-end virtual reality experience for a fraction of the price of Samsung’s peripheral.</p><p>It is, of course, not the company’s first VR headset. In typical LeEco fashion, the company’s already got a bunch on the market already – because when LeEco does something, it does a lot of it. Most compelling of its current offerings in the space is a standalone VR headset that runs about $200, removing the handset from the equation entirely.</p><p>But, while someone I spoke with at an event for the company assured me that that model provides the best experience of all of the offerings LeEco has in China, there’s no word when or if such a thing might arrive here in the States. The ExploreVR, on the other hand, is coming, but when and for exactly how much have yet to be determined – though it will apparently be well under the Gear’s $99 asking price.</p><p>From a design standpoint, it looks a fair bit like the Gear. There’s a touch control pad on the side, a USB-C port for charging on the bottom and a slot in the front for the phone (in this case the LeMax 2 Pro), with a reflective front face that snaps over.</p><p>The most notable aesthetic difference is the swapping of the headband for a large plastic curve that rests of top of the head, weighted in the back to keep it in place. It’s not as adjustable as the headband, and it’s more likely to muss your hair than Samsung’s offering. But it’s certainly different. So that’s something.</p><p>The headset fits reasonably well and there’s enough room inside to use it with a pair of glasses. Since there’s no band to hold it in place, it will end up resting on your nose. The rep I spoke with added that there will be some aesthetic tweaks to the hardware before it hits the US, but refused to go into detail.</p><p>The device uses LeEco’s own content store (not up and running on these units) with mostly Chinese language VR video. Interestingly, the company also plans to open the its content store up to 3D party hardware, like the Rift, Vive and Gear. The demo I got featured two short videos – 3D guided trips through classic paintings.</p><p>The motion was a bit jerky and there was some clear distortion around the borders of the lenses, which doesn’t bode well for the ultimate experience, given that these were fairly controlled demos.</p><p>Depending on how much the hardware ultimately costs, the sheer price point may make it tempting for some viewers, but the company is about to get an awful lot more completion through Daydream headsets (LeEco said it has no plan to develop for that platform at the moment).</p><p>Of course, there’s a built-in audience of those who buy LeEco handsets (ExploreVR will apparently be compatible with all of the phones the company sells in the States), and if the company can build a large enough English language content library, there could be some appeal there, as well.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Here’s fuel to the fire for those who believe that Facebook will buy anything that looks, smells or moves like Snapchat. The U. S. social networking giant this summer made an unsuccessful bid to acquire Snow, a Snapchat-like service from Naver, the $25 billion-valued Korean firm behind chat app Line, a source close to the company told TechCrunch.</p><p>Snow has around 80 million downloads, and it is adding around 10 million more each month, according to the source. That growth has also encouraged acquisition interest from Tencent — the maker of blockbuster chat app WeChat — Alibaba and others, TechCrunch understands.</p><p>“It’s true that Snow is receiving love calls from various companies,” a representative from Naver told us in a statement. Despite acknowledging outside interest, Naver did not name Snow’s would-be suitors.</p><p>Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The app first grabbed attention in the summer when it raced up Android and iOS app store rankings in Korea, Japan and China, collecting some 30 million downloads. A feature story from The New York Times in July, which explained that Snow and Naver were exploiting Snapchat’s apparent lack of interest in Asia, only served to heighten awareness of the app.</p><p>Sometime after that story, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg got wind of Snow and contacted Naver Chairman Hae-Jin Lee over the phone with an offer to acquire it. Naver saw Line raise over $1 billion in a dual Japan-U. S. IPO in July of this year, and Lee rejected Facebook’s overtures because he believes Snow has the potential to become a similar success.</p><p>Indeed, Naver strengthened ties between the two services in September when Line made a $45 million investment in Snow that gave the social app a valuation of $180 million — not bad for a one-year-old project. With Line struggling to grow its userbase outside of its largest markets of Japan, Thailand and Taiwan, Snow is viewed as a key ally that could help the chat app broaden its appeal in more parts of Asia.</p><p>While it is easy to label Snow as a Snapchat clone, the app does have some differentiated features.</p><p>For one thing, Naver has worked hard to localize the service in markets, much the same way as it did with Line when the chat app emerged in 2011-2012. Most notably, it is working with celebrities in Korea and Japan, where it sees the most traction and potential, to feature their stories prominently inside the app alongside live streams, too. That helps encourage users back into the app for more reasons than simply to message their friends, while it also may unlock monetizable options in the future.</p><p>The app itself has over 36 filters and more than 200 masks, offering considerably more customization options than Snapchat — a move that is in line with appealing to its core audience in Asia. Some options include filters for both images and videos that involve celebrities, cartoon characters, fairies and even one scene as a drunken ‘salary man’ making a toast.</p><p>Snapchat — now just ‘Snap’ — is widely reported to be gearing up for an IPO next year that could value the company at around $25 billion. The latest suggestion is that it could raise $4 billion from a listing.</p><p>Those figures certainly vindicate CEO Evan Spiegel’s decision to reject a $3 billion bid from Facebook three years ago — even if conventional wisdom at the time suggested he was making a mistake.</p><p>It is still early days for Snow, and it remains to be seen whether this will be another app that Facebook will rue missing out on over time.</p><p>For now, Facebook is trying to turn its own properties into Snapchat-like competitors using heavy doses of ‘product inspiration’.</p><p>Instagram Stories, a feature that the company admits is inspired by Snapchat, reached a very respectable 100 million users within two months, while Facebook has launched smaller projects that include a social video app that’s just for teens, a Snapchat-like camera feature, and a fairly blatant Snapchat clone that is being tested in Poland.</p>",

And no, it’s not a scam.</p><p>Over the years, consumers have been burned by websites offering “free” credit reports which had more than a few strings attached. After signing up for their free report, these misleading sites would then begin billing the unsuspecting users on a monthly basis after their trial periods ended. That’s why it’s been refreshing to use Credit Karma, a service which offers free credit monitoring and free credit scores that are actually free, not free*.</p><p>I’ve been a somewhat obsessed user of the Credit Karma iOS app in recent months, now that I have a near-term goal of applying for a new mortgage. I’ve been working to clean up the old, negative items on my credit report, and it’s a little thrill to log in to the app to see the score increase as these changes are made.</p><p>Credit Karma, through a partnership with TransUnion and VantageScore (a scoring system for all three credit agencies) has been providing users like myself with updated credit scores on a weekly basis for some time.</p><p>In addition, the service alerts users to changes on their credit reports, like balance decreases or increases, credit limit changes, hard credit inquires, new accounts, and other items.  It also offers you a “credit report card” which grades you on each aspect of your credit history and behavior, including your open credit card utilization, percent of on-time payments, average age of open credit card lines, and more. More importantly, it explains how each item works and why it matters, which goes a long way toward demystifying consumer credit.</p><p>Based on your own credit history and profile, Credit Karma generates revenue by referring you to related services like credit cards, loan products, or debt consolidation industries. I actually ended up contracting with a service called Lexington Law thanks to the app, which is doing the busy work of writing the letters to the various credit agencies on my behalf, asking them to remove the negative items that should have dropped off ages ago. (Yes, I know I could do this myself, but I don’t have time.)</p><p>Credit Karma notes that 25% of consumers have errors on their report that might affect their score, and 33% of people have never checked their report. Meanwhile, the average consumer’s credit score is 633 but the threshold for having what’s considered “good” credit is 720.</p><p>Unfortunately, one thing Credit Karma didn’t have until now was access to consumer’s full credit reports, instead presenting you with more of a summary of where you stand financially. So you would still have to go through the normal procedures to request your once-per-year free report, or pay a company to pull it for you. With today’s rollout, that changes, as consumers’ credit reports are being made available within Credit Karma for free at any time. They can also be refreshed on as often as a weekly basis, if you choose.</p><p>As per usual, Credit Karma doesn’t just present the information, but explains what it means and recommends actions you should take.</p><p>The deal for these new reports is with TransUnion again, so technically, it’s one of three credit reports available to consumers. When TransUnion retrieves your credit report they do so by requesting your credit information on your behalf, which is known as a “soft inquiry.” These types of inquires aren’t shown to creditors so they don’t affect your credit the way that “hard inquiries” can.</p><p>The move should help Credit Karma better compete with traditional credit monitoring agencies as well as with more direct competitors like score provider and financial advisor ReadyForZero as well as with Credit Sesame, which also offers free credit scores and summaries, but today charges $9 for access to credit reports.</p><p>Below, a dummy report so you can see what it looks like:</p>",

This will affect apps that use methods like fraudulent installs, fake reviews, and incentivized ratings, the company noted.</p><p>While Google already had technology it used to detect these sorts of manipulation attempts, the new system is a step forward in terms of its accuracy. When it detects an app that has moved up the charts through ill-gotten means, the system will filter it. In addition, developers who continue to engage in these practices will have their apps taken down from Google Play.</p><p>As the company explains, not only do such manipulations violate the Google Play Developer Policy, they also harm the wider community. Other developers whose apps should otherwise be highly ranked would end up lower in the charts, as a result, and users would be pointed to apps in the top charts that didn’t deserve to be there.</p><p>Of course, monitoring its app store for fraud and spam isn’t something that’s unique to Google Play. Apple, too, has often faced this problem on its own iTunes App Store, as well. Often, app developers will buy downloads in order to juice their rankings, given how the top charts favor metrics like installs and download velocity combined.</p><p>Over the years, we’ve seen everything from automated download bots to spammy app install ads to outright scams to fake ratings and more – all attempts by shady developers to earn a better chart rank than their app naturally deserved.</p><p>This same problem affects Google Play, even though app discovery on the Play Store isn’t as driven by the Top Charts, as on iTunes.

Now you can add a debit card, type a dollar amount into Snapchat’s text-chat feature, and hit the green pay button to instantly send a friend money. The feature is on Android now and is coming to iOS soon.</p><p>We first reported that Snapchat had filed trademarks around payments in July, and now we know why. Beyond p2p payments, the trademarks could prime Snapchat for ecommerce and payments to merchants as well. For example, the app could one day send you a Snap or show a Story ad from a mechant, and let you buy the product shown instantly through Snapchat. Depending on how its relationship with Square Cash works, Snapchat could also potentially cross-reference debit card info through Snapcash-connected accounts to improve its ad targeting.</p><p>You can see how Snapcash works, with some extra song and dance here:</p><p>Essentially, 18+ US users sign up by adding a Visa or Mastercard debit card. All their account details are held by Square Cash, you don’t have to worry as much about trusting Snapchat, which has had privacy and security problems in past.</p><p>While in Snapchat text-chat, you type in “$” then the dollar amount you want to send. Snapchat recognizes you’re trying to pay, changes the send button to a green Snapcash button, and tapping it deposits money into a friend’s account. That cash will be waiting for them when they sign up if they haven’t already. If the friend doesn’t sign-up to accept the payment within 24 hours, the cash will be refunded so you don’t have to worry about money…disappearing.</p><p>Being featured in Snapchat will net Jack Dorsey’s company brand exposure and credit card numbers. There may be a financial agreement between Snapchat and Square, but they’re staying tight-lipped on that. Snapchat did say it was interested in possibly offering more payment methods such as credit cards or bank accounts, though Square only handles Visa and Mastercard debit cards for now.</p><p>The Snapcash deal could be big for Square Cash’s competitive strategy as it tries to edge out Venmo, Google Wallet, and more for the p2p payments market. None have gained widespread consumer adoption, even though they can be extraordinarily helpful. I use Venmo regularly for splitting dinners, drinks, cabs, or trips with friends.</p><p>But by wedging itself into p2p payments through a consumer app that tens of millions of people already regularly use with their close friends, Snapcash could inject itself into the lives of people who never considered downloading a finance app.</p>",

The results will also include information like how many more electoral votes a presidential candidate needs to win, how many seats are up for grabs in the House and Senate, and how many Gubernatorial races are underway, among other things.</p><p>This data is presented in an easy-to-read format, with Democrats in blue, Republicans in red, and simple graphs, alongside the key numbers.</p><p>While Google has offered voter assistance tools for years in past elections, the company has really stepped up its game in this most recent cycle, with the rollout of web and mobile tools that helped people figure out how to register, how to vote or vote early, where to find their polls, who’s on the ballot, and more. It also made those guides available in Spanish.</p><p>And Google heavily pushed voters to get involved with home page ads on its usually sparse Google.com site. In addition, it’s today running a banner at the top of Gmail that offers to show you where to vote – something it hasn’t done in years past. The Google Doodle is also being used to remind people of the election.</p><p>The increased efforts come at a time when more people are turning to the web to get information about the elections. The company says it has seen a 233 percent increase in search traffic for the phrase “how to vote” compared with the 2012 elections, for example.</p><p>The election results will be made available as soon as the polls close on Election Day, says Google. The company also notes it will be live streaming election news on YouTube via the channels offered by NBC, PBS, MTV, Bloomberg, Telemundo, The Young Turks, and others. Already, viewers spent over 20 million hours watching and rewatching the debate live streams on the site, the company added.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Elucify, a member of the Y Combinator Winter 2016 class wants to solve an annoying and persistent problem for sales people — making sure they have the most recent customer contact data.</p><p>To solve this problem, the company created a plug-in for Salesforce.com CRM based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. The system connects to various public and private data sources looking for the most current contact information, according to Gerald Fong, Elucify CEO and co-founder.</p><p>Sales personnel simply click the Elucify button in the Salesforce record, and the tool updates the existing contact information and lists any new contacts found at the company. Typically it looks at information such as phone number, email address, current decision makers, updated company information — all the types of data a busy sales team needs. It usually takes just 5 or 10 seconds to update the record, according to Fong.</p><p>“The pain point we are focusing on is the pain sales teams run into every day. They spend time hunting for [good contact] data every day. Instead of spending time on the phone, they are spending a lot of time on various websites trying to verify [contact] information,” Fong told TechCrunch.</p><p>In most companies this forces people to spend time manually cleaning up their contact information, but Elucify automates that process on a per record basis.</p><p>Most sales teams work with Customer Relationship Management tools like Salesforce to track this information. As such, you wouldn’t think this would be a huge problem, but according to data from eConsultancy, sales and marketing pros estimate that as much as 30 percent of their contact data is bad.</p><p>The company has only been in existence for a few months, yet it went from ideation to Y Combinator in a matter of week, and it already already boasts three Beta customers.</p><p>The three company co-founders — which include Fong, Mihir Deo and Naveen Krishnamurthi — have found being part of Y Combinator has given them access to people with experience starting enterprise companies. The founders got YC president Sam Altman as their advisor and as young founders, they are finding the advice they are getting is helping them solve problems and open doors.</p><p>“We are starting an enterprise software company. Getting someone to pay you money is difficult. We are talking to people [in the Y Combinator network] about what mistakes they made and what problems we are thinking about,” Fong said.</p><p>Their advisors and network contacts have already considered many of the issues they face on a daily basis and are helping them identify where to focus their energies.</p><p>As for the future, they just want to keep building on their early wins. CRM is a huge market and Salesforce has 60 percent of that market, Wong pointed out.</p><p>“Our goals to make a big dent in the [market of] people using Salesforce.” If they can do that, that’s a lot of potential customers. Down the road they hope to add their functionality to other CRM tools as well.</p>",

This should help them — sorry, you — conserve data and avoid running out of your limited unlimited data allowance. And really, who really needs better than “quality similar to DVD” on their phone or tablet’s 1080p screen?</p><p>YouTube and Google Play agree to join T-Mobile's Binge On Program, following criticism of video throttling</p><p>Net neutrality withstands legal challenge</p><p>New FCC rule protects users from the prying eyes of ISPs</p><p>The data will still count toward your monthly usage, though.

The company today announced the launch of new apps for the Android TV and Amazon Fire TV which will add the new, more immersive video format to CBSN’s news coverage, kicking off with a 360-degree behind-the-scenes look into the filming of a 60 Minutes episode.</p><p>The episode in question is one that involves looking for gorillas in Africa – a subject that makes for an interesting use case for the technology, given how it enables viewers to further explore the scene as they accompany the news team on a journey through the continent.</p><p>While some may see 360-degree video today as being more fun than practical, the CBS News Digital team believes the format will become an increasingly important means of storytelling, including within the news genre it focusing on.</p><p>“Our new apps for Fire TV and Android TV featuring 360-degree video capabilities mark a major step forward in terms of how viewers will experience and interact with news in the future,” noted Christy Tanner, Senior Vice President and General Manager, CBS News Digital, in a statement about the launch.</p><p>The 60 Minutes video is only the first of many the company has planned.</p><p>A new playlist in the app will feature only 360-degree videos, for easier access to this content. Similar to interacting with 360-degree videos on the desktop, where users click around to explore the scene, viewers will instead be able to use their remote control to navigate through the videos.</p><p>360-degree videos are the standout feature found in the new apps, which have also been redesigned and will offer other features for finding related videos, editorially curated video playlists, and a personalized playlist of favorite videos.</p><p>The launch comes at time when CBSN’s streaming news service broke records, thanks to the U. S. election. The company earlier reported 19.1 million streams and 11.1 million viewers on election night, which toppled the prior record of 2.98 million streams and 1.4 million uniques on the night of first presidential debate.</p><p>The company didn’t break out how many people were tuning in via their connected TVs versus the desktop or mobile, however, but it has found that it’s attracting younger viewers, while the average viewer age is 38.</p><p>Supporting newer technology like 360-degree videos could give it something that would help it to pull in more of those key younger demographics going forward, assuming it’s ability to produce quality videos using this format.</p><p>While 360-degree videos have been popping up more than ever over the web, mobile and on Facebook, their use in news is still more limited.</p><p>That said, CBSN is hardly the first to experiment i this area.</p><p>ABC News launched a VR experience last fall to allow for a tour of Syria’s capital, and it more recently took viewers to Times Square on election night. The NYT launched its own initiative to integrate 360-degree videos into its daily news report, in addition to its standalone NYT VR app. Euronews has also shot dozens of videos in 360 degrees, across 13 countries.  And The Hill tested out connecting with younger viewers on Snapchat using 360-degree videos on election night.</p><p>Most news organizations are only testing the waters with 360-degree videos, however, and are waiting to see how viewers respond. The hope is that the format offers a better way to tell a story, and can better engage viewers on social media platforms, where much news content (for better or for worse) is shared.</p><p>In addition, unlike traditional VR, 360-degree videos don’t require a separate headset to view, which gives them an advantage in terms of reach.</p><p>CBSN also has apps on Apple TV, PlayStation, Roku, and Xbox platforms, but didn’t say when its redesign would hit all platforms.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Amazon is beefing up its Home Services business — a marketplace rival to the likes of Angie’s List, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack and Handy for helping people find and hire contractors for everything from plumbers to at-home reflexologists.</p><p>Today, the company added 20 more metro areas, one of its most significant expansions of Home Services since launching in March 2015, and bringing the number of markets covered to 50. New cities getting added today include Indianapolis, IN; Las Vegas, NV; San Antonio, TX; Ann Arbor, MI; Cleveland, OH; Milwaukee, WI; Boulder, CO; Raleigh, NC and Trenton, NJ.</p><p>The news comes at a time of other developments in the home services category.</p><p>First, Amazon itself appears to be considering entering into another, related on-demand area: housekeeping and helping people organise their lives.</p><p>Last week, the Seattle Times spotted Amazon job openings for a new role at Amazon called “Home Assistant.” This is a concierge-style service where the employee “will be an expert in helping Amazon customers keep up their home…working with customers each day with tidying up around the home, laundry, and helping put groceries and essentials like toilet paper and paper towels away. You will assure that customers return to an errand-free home,” according to one of the ads. We’ve contacted Amazon for a comment and will update as we learn more.</p><p>A few months earlier, Google launched a beta version of its own home services platform, where consumers can search and find for professionals for tasks by typing in keywords into Google. This appears to be live only in the Bay Area at the moment.</p><p>Meanwhile, there is also some consolidation underway in the market: Angie’s List — which last year rejected a $512 million acquisition from IAC’s HomeAdvisor for being too low — hasn’t had a smooth time of it, and now, one year on, it’s laying off employees and exploring strategic alternatives. The company currently has a market cap of around $517 million.</p><p>Amidst that competitive landscape, Amazon has been relatively quiet about its own Home Services effort in the last several months, with a lot of the company’s consumer hullabaloo continuing to swirl around its latest efforts to double down on its Echo voice-responsive home hub and the multiple cloud-based services that can be used in conjunction or alongside it.</p><p>Home Services is somewhat related to this. It is, essentially, one more on-demand offering and cloud-based marketplace that leverages Amazon’s giant network effect and gives people one more way of making customers’ lives run more smoothly. But it is also fairly distinct and somewhat anachronistic, couched as it is in a fairly time-honored, traditional way of getting things done — by looking to skilled craftspeople for help.</p><p>Given the wider developments in the U. S. right now, it will be interesting to see how services like Amazon’s fare. In one regard, trades like plumbing may be immune to the rising and falling tides of the economy: a blocked toilet is a blocked toilet, after all. In another, many services may not be quite as essential and will be impacted with a fall in consumer spending or other forces that would put a squeeze on disposable income. On the other hand,, if the housing market declines, another area like home improvements could be positively impacted as home owners might be less inclined to move house and more motivated to spruce up the place where they live.</p><p>Amazon is, in keeping with its usual practice, not giving much away about how successful Home Services has been to date, but it’s definitely growing in terms of supplier interest. Amazon said that the number of service providers has gone up 1,500 percent, and it now covers 60 professions and 1,200 unique services.</p><p>“We’re thrilled to be offering more Amazon customers access to our network of trusted pros throughout the U. S.,” said Nish Lathia, General Manager of Amazon Home Services, in a statement. “Today, customers can search over 1,200 unique services from pros in over 60 professions – from house cleaning, to lawn work and beyond. The availability of Home Services in more cities means that more customers can quickly find and schedule the help they need around the house heading into the holiday season.”</p><p>It also notes that the services most popular with customers include TV wall-mounting, house cleaning and furniture assembly.</p>",

    "content": "<p>While most mobile applications today are heavily concerned with getting users to remember to open them regularly, mobile deal-finding application Shopular has been content to run in the background, alerting consumers to sales and discounts when they’re in a store or mall. Now, its focus on practicality over spammy behavior has paid off, in the form of a $6.4 million Series A round, led by Sequoia Capital. Sequoia’s Tim Lee will also join Shopular’s board of directors.</p><p>The startup had previously raised a seed round from Y Combinator and other angel investors, including Adam D’Angelo.</p><p>Shopular first emerged just ahead of the 2012 holiday season, after participation in Y Combinator’s Winter 2012 batch. Founded by former Shopkick engineers, Navneet Loiwal and Tommy Tsai, Shopular offers a different take on mobile deal-finding than their previous company’s solution.</p><p>“We have a lot of respect for Shopkick for showing the world mobile can be used in novel ways for physical retail,” says Loiwal. However, the team wanted to build something that was more intuitive and logical for consumers. Where Shopkick rewards users for walking into stores and making purchases, Shopular is a tap on the shoulder letting you know why you should walk into a store.</p><p>The company uses its own proprietary technology to source deals, grabbing everything posted online, emailed offers, and even items posted to retailers’ Facebook Pages. It combines these into a deals database, which today includes deal info for a majority of retailers here in the U. S., from big names like Walmart, Target, Home Depot and others, down to speciality women’s clothing retailers, beauty brands, jewelry stores, kids’ shops, and more.</p><p>Consumers, meanwhile, can configure the app further by selecting their favorite stores, or opting in to hear about upcoming sales, but as Loiwal had previously explained, “the minimum you need to do is put the app on your phone. Forget about the app, and you’ll start saving money every time you go out shopping.”</p><p>Today Shopular works in 40,000 store locations across all 50 U. S. states, giving it coverage on nearly every mall, strip mall, or standalone big box store. Loiwal declined to provide user numbers or engagement metrics, however, only pointing at the app’s 10,000-some ratings on iTunes and Google Play, where it has a 5-star and 4.8-star rating, respectively. He also noted that Shopular’s demographics are 80 percent female, with two distinct groups – teenagers who spend a lot of time in malls, and younger, budget-conscious moms ages 25 to 35.</p><p>Until now, the focus for Shopular has been on growing its customer base and store coverage, not revenue, but with the new funding, the company plans to take the next step which involves working with retailers directly. Loiwal says they’ve already begun running tests with select retailers on a feature that would allow the brands to communicate with shoppers via the app.</p><p>“Retailers have two main problems: getting foot traffic to their stores, and second, communicating with the consumer when they’re walking into the store rather than checking out,” Loiwal explains. Shopular will serve as middleman for those messages. The question the company is trying to answer now is how many conversions it can make for a business when it has the ability to reach out to the people around you. “We saw metrics that were on par on some of the big networks that were used to run the same promotion and the same time,” adds Loiwal of these early experiments.</p><p>Other things Shopular is keeping its eye on include retailer adoption of Apple’s iBeacon technology and user demand for an iPad-optimized version of the Shopular app. But the bigger focus will be on increasing the app’s personalization aspects by taking advantage of all the data it has built up on consumer behavior over the course of the year.</p><p>“We’re trying to understand you better through your use of the app, but also understand how similar you are to other users,” explains Loiwal. “And we’re working on something that could provide you value that goes on beyond the coupon,” he teases, but declining to provide details.</p><p>The startup has been running fairly lean with just a four-person team, but with the infusion of capital from Sequoia, it plans to hire at least nine people over the next few months, split between engineers and those in product design, marketing and sales.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the app competes with not only Shopkick, but also other mobile deal finders including RetailMeNot, Jifiti (to some extent), couponing apps like SnipSnap, daily deals apps, and others.</p><p>An updated, more iOS 7-friendly version of the app is also poised to ship, but in the meantime, you can check out either the iOS or Android app here.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Editor’s Note: Albert Lai is the CTO of Media at Brightcove.</p><p>Which would you rather do: pay for all available content or only the content you consume?</p><p>At first blush, this would seem like a simple cost issue: why not cancel your cable subscription in favor of Netflix, Hulu or Prime Instant Video – or all three? Instead of spending $70 a month for content you don’t watch, you could spend under $10 on just the things you do watch.</p><p>Unbundling – whether as part of a pay TV or a digital over the top (OTT) offering – has been suggested as the Holy Grail for the “future” of television and video.</p><p>In a simplistic generalization, unbundling would remove the subsidization of pay TV, banishing the requirement for every pay TV subscriber to bear the cost of content that only a portion of the subscriber base actually wants and consumes, e.g., sports content, typically the most expensive channels.</p><p>Ostensibly, the logic makes sense. But when you follow it further, the reality for many households is that their broadband Internet access is provided by pay TV operators.</p><p>Even if they decide to become cord cutters – or more accurately, pay TV cutters – their access to OTT content will still be dependent on the broadband pricing policies of the very same pay TV provider, who have incentives to “optimize” pricing, performance, and features around their offering, whether broadcast or digital.</p><p>The issue is not just about paying for content, but the dependency in how content is accessed.</p><p>Premium Content May Drive, But Pay TV Owns The Roads</p><p>Recently, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed redefining the term Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (MVPD) from its current meaning – which is limited to broadcast, cable and satellite-based TV providers – to be technology neutral, expanding to include Internet TV programmers. In an effort to make it easier for companies to offer new competitive broadband networks, the expanded definition would also “permit a new broadband competitor to offer customers the ability to reach a variety of OTT video packages without necessarily having to enter the video business itself.”</p><p>If the race is between new, alternative broadband providers coming to market and existing pay TV operators accelerating their digital innovation and business models, the latter has a significant head start. Companies like Comcast have already executed on their strategy to hedge the future of television through investments in both traditional (NBCU, Time Warner Cable) and digital (Xfinity, X2, RDK, ThePlatform, FreeWheel) initiatives.</p><p>But the underlying friction isn’t about lack of content restricting Internet access – it’s simply about access. Prior to its merger with AT&T, DirecTV CEO Michael White stated its need to “ride on somebody else’s highway”, highlighting the dependency of premium content on digital access.</p><p>While this recent proposal focused on the definition of the MVPD, the FCC’s assumption that this opens the door to new broadband providers ignores the challenges with existing access. With the growth of digital options, increased consumption, and the trend to higher resolution content (i.e., 4K), more and more bits and bytes are filling the existing pipes and airwaves.</p><p>President Obama also recently released a statement emphasizing that for the FCC “there is no higher calling than protecting an open, accessible, and free Internet.” The proposal stated that the FCC should “reclassify consumer broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act — while at the same time forbearing from rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services.”</p><p>This would effectively treat the Internet as a utility. The proposal’s four stated rules emphasized the following tenets: no blocking, no throttling, increased transparency, and no paid prioritization. These are critical issues when viewed in context of Netflix’s recent paid peering arrangements with Comcast and Verizon.</p><p>As traditional companies like HBO, CBS, and Sony deploy their OTT services and as new entrants take shape, the focus on access and connectivity will only intensify. Even HBO’s announcement of their OTT service was not a full break from the pay TV ecosystem, as HBO CEO Richard Plepler stated its OTT service is less disruptive to the existing pay TV relationship and more about cooperation to realize new revenues based on “their [pay TV’s] broadband. They’re going to make money. I think this is a great inflection point for all of our businesses.”</p><p>Cord-cutting may be the most talked about disruptive trend, but what we need to be watching is the evolution of access. Consequently, the future of OTT is not just about content unbundling but about access to consumers, and that relationship is dependent on moving digital bits across pipes controlled in large part by the pay TV ecosystem.</p>",

They’re looking to price it at $2 per transaction.</p><p>Skylock is a connected bike lock that allows the user to control it with their phone. The highlighted features of the $249 lock, which you can pre-order separately at $159 for a limited time, include alerting you if someone is stealing your bike, reporting emergencies if you get into an accident and unlocking the bike with your phone (and allowing your friends to do so). The Skylock is entirely solar-powered.</p><p>The central hub for Skyride will be situated in a geo-fenced area in the middle of a city, and once a rider rents a bike and lock from the app, it will unlock as lock detects the rider’s phone. The rider will be charged a flat rate for every 30 minutes of their trip.</p><p>The benefit of Skyride as opposed to other bike-share options is that you don’t have to drop the bike off at a specific hub. All you have to do is lock the bike anywhere and the next interested rider can rent and unlock it as they approach. The locks are equipped with a GPS chip, allowing users to find a bike that is not already taken.</p><p>When the bike is locked, the app will ask the rider if they are done with the ride and will stop charging for the session once they confirm.</p><p>So if you want to stop by the grocery store for 10 minutes, you can lock the bike and still have it reserved while you shop. Of course, you will be charged for the duration of time that you have reserved the bike.</p><p>Moving back to Skylock, it’s important to note the similarity to Lock8, winner of TechCrunch Disrupt Europe last October. Lock8 allows the rider to rent their bike with users of the Lock8 app. It is keyless, alerts you if your bike is being stolen, has integrated GPS and is induction charged. Right now it’s priced at $249.</p><p>Jack Al-Kahwati, CEO of Velo Labs, said the company is preparing a pilot program in two unnamed countries in Asia, where they are working with universities, municipalities and companies interested in the bike-share network.</p><p>Anyone can earn money renting bikes through Skyride, and affiliates pay a 15 percent revenue share for the use of Skylocks. They plan to release an enterprise version with a subscription tiered pricing plan.</p><p>The company plans to use normal bicycles, as opposed to specially constructed ones.</p><p>They hope to launch the service in San Francisco first after they determine the success of the pilot program.</p>",

This program, launched earlier this spring, gave Android developers the ability to better reach early adopters willing to try their app while still in beta, ahead of its public launch. Through the “Early Access” section on the Google Play Store, users could discover a curated list of interesting, new applications to download.</p><p>Initially, inclusion in this program was only available to a hand-picked group of 29 app and game partners, but today Google is opening up “Early Access” more broadly.</p><p>Though Google already offered a way for developers to run open beta tests for their apps, in May it began allowing developers to enroll users into beta tests right from the Play Store landing pages. Meanwhile, the idea with the “Early Access” collection on Google Play was to highlight the best upcoming applications for those developers who don’t yet have an active user community.</p><p>In just over a month after the collection became available to all Google Play users, the open beta titles were installed more than 1 million times. Launch partners like language learning developer Lingbe, online book club Readfeed and Lego were among those who participated in “Early Access,” using their spot to attract users, validate their app’s concept, get feedback, identify bugs, test game mechanics and more.</p><p>However, being featured in “Early Access” was previously based on Google’s discretion alone. There was no way to request a spot. Today, that changes — Google is introducing a sign-up process for Android developers, which will allow them to nominate their app for consideration.</p><p>That’s not a guarantee that the app will be included in “Early Access,” of course, but it’s a way to at least request inclusion. Google says new titles will be added weekly, and thousands of users are available to test.</p><p>The program’s expansion comes at a time when Google (and Apple) are working on better ways to help indie developers have their applications discovered in what have become sizable mobile application marketplaces. Google Play now has more than 2 million apps available for download, which means finding new apps and games to try by browsing the top charts or categories isn’t always efficient. Often, users find new apps via app store search, advertising and word-of-mouth recommendations.</p><p>Being able to test an app ahead of launch to work out the kinks is valuable, as you may only have one shot at retaining a user’s interest after download… if they ever launch the app at all.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Do you have trouble making decisions? Do you have to get your friends’ input on a bunch of things? Are you 15 years old? Then you might like Pop, a new iPhone application today making its official debut, which lets you quickly ask your friends for feedback by sending them two photos.</p><p>Basically, Pop is a simple voting app with a more limited number of choices compared to other social polling tools like Polar, Thumb, Loop, Voto, and several others. Instead, the interface here resembles Frontback, with one photo on top and the other below. Meanwhile, the quick decision-making Pop demands is reminiscent of dating apps like Hot or Not or Tinder.</p><p>The user experience in Pop is straightforward: You take two pictures, optionally type a question, then pick your audience, which could be “users nearby,” “friends nearby,” or “all friends.”</p><p>You can also scroll through your contacts list to select individuals but because the app is lacking a search function or a decent scrolling feature, this is almost impossible to manage – at least until the contact picker gets fixed in the forthcoming app update, as promised.</p><p>Or to put it more plainly, unless you get a group of friends to join you on Pop, or you’re in an area where there are a good number of Pop users, there’s not much you can do right now. Popped questions can’t be shared more broadly to social networks like Facebook or Twitter, which seems like a miss. Instead, users who don’t have the app on their phone are sent a text message that prompts them to download it. This can be a delicate area, as unwanted texts – even from friends – can be viewed as spam.</p><p>But the app’s co-creator Thomas Lee says the team is working to launch Pop at local college campuses, which they see as being the target market for the app. (I’d think high-schoolers would be better, but what do I know? I’m old.)</p><p>“People would usually ask people things like ‘what shirt should I buy?’ or ‘what should I wear tonight?,’ but it’s very annoying taking pictures over text or on FB messenger,” explains Lee, who built the app with Khalid Karim, and Alessia Vettese, as a part of Toronto-based Next 36‘s accelerator program. “We wanted to build Pop out of sheer frustration for a more streamlined solution; we essentially built it for ourselves,” he says.</p><p>The team threw the app together in about a month, and the first version launched in mid-February. Now comes the larger challenge: getting people to actually use the thing, which is easier said than done. But Pop is fun, simple to use, and leans heavily on elements of already popular apps, which could help give it a push.</p><p>You can give it a shot yourself – it’s a free download here.</p>",

    "content": "<p>When Amazon, Twitter, PayPal, Spotify and other major websites were rendered inaccessible on Friday, thousands of Americans learned firsthand what a DDoS attack feels like.</p><p>DDoS — distributed denial of service — is an unsophisticated form of attack that overwhelms sites with spam traffic so legitimate users can’t get through. DDoS is a war of economics: whoever has the most computing power, defender or attacker, usually wins.</p><p>This makes DDoS a useful tool for censorship of small and mid-level publishers, but major sites usually have defenses in place and aren’t susceptible to these attacks. However, Friday wasn’t business as usual. The series of attacks that took out Dyn, the DNS service that provides the backbone of many major sites, were powered in part by a botnet of hacked DVRs and and webcams known as Mirai. Mirai first emerged several weeks ago during a DDoS against Brian Krebs, a cybersecurity journalist who runs his own publication KrebsOnSecurity.com.</p><p>The DDoS attack on Krebs, the scramble for protection that followed, and Friday’s massive attack mark a new chapter in DDoS. More and more websites are being forced to seek shelter behind a shrinking number of powerful DDoS protection providers. But that centralization means that, as potent botnets like Mirai become stronger, larger sections of the internet can be knocked offline during attacks.</p><p>Mirai is irritating for the American internet users who couldn’t access their favorite websites Friday, and a thorn in the side of companies that are now forced to recall their easily hacked IoT devices — but the botnet is also influencing the market for DDoS protection.</p><p>In late September, Krebs’ website was hit with a DDoS attack of unprecedented scale. The content delivery network Akamai had protected KrebsOnSecurity from more than 250 DDoS attacks over four years, but it struggled to withstand this record-breaking onslaught of fake traffic and, after several more attacks, booted Krebs from its service.</p><p>“It was the biggest attack we’d ever seen. We were protecting someone for free and it was taking a lot of resources,” Akamai security advocate Martin McKeay told TechCrunch. “That was when the decision was made — this was a customer who we were protecting for marketing reasons but it was taking too much of our resources to make this a viable thing longterm. He looks into criminals who do DDoS, who do carding and skimming. It just was not worth the good will for us to protect someone who was thumbing their nose at the bad guys.”</p><p>But Akamai’s decision wasn’t just about conserving its human and technological resources. The DDoS attack was so large that it was overloading surrounding internet infrastructure, McKeay said. The attacks had the potential to cause slowdowns for the company’s paying customers. Many of the attacks that had hit Krebs’ website previously were sending 3-4 gigabits per second, but the Mirai attacks were in the 500 – 600 gbps range.</p><p>Still, Akamai tried to stick with Krebs. The company asked some of its paying Prolexic customers to temporarily turn off the service to make more bandwidth available in the Krebs fight, and to avoid issues on their own websites. Such requests often come during maintenance, according to Akamai, and shouldn’t cause alarm. But TechCrunch is aware of at least one Akamai customer who was shaken by the request — the company contacted a competing DDoS protection service days later.</p><p>However, Akamai says it lost no customers due to the Krebs DDoS. “After having successfully protected Krebs’ site during the attack, his was the only site that was then transitioned to another solution,” Akamai spokesperson Jeff Young told TechCrunch. “It’s common to proactively notify customers anytime we perceive the possibility of unexpected traffic flows.  The vast majority of notifications sent are welcomed by the customer.”</p><p>When the news broke that Krebs was leaving Akamai, other DDoS protection services swarmed, offering their services. With the massive DDoS attack making headlines and Krebs without protection, it was the perfect opportunity for another provider to make a name for themselves.</p><p>DDoS protection services protect against online attacks that use large networks of computers to spam a site with junk traffic, ultimately knocking the site offline. Claiming Krebs as a client would be a powerful marketing moment for a DDoS protection provider, enabling the company to say they stood up to the strongest DDoS attack the internet had ever seen. Several free and paid DDoS services approached Krebs in the days following the attack on his site.</p><p>In the end, Krebs went to Project Shield, a Google-backed DDoS protection service that works exclusively with journalists, human rights organizations and elections monitoring sites. Cloudflare’s Project Galileo, which protects public interest websites that feature political or artistic content, also made a bid to protect Krebs. An unnamed company offered two weeks of free protection, followed by services that would cost $150,000 – $200,000 per year, Krebs reported.</p><p>Krebs wrote that Akamai gave him just two hours to migrate off its network, and Akamai later told the Boston Globe that the attack could have ended up costing the company millions of dollars. “We made a business decision to no longer keep this customer on our platform and prioritize our resources on our paying customers,” Young told the Globe.</p><p>I do not fault Akamai for their decision. I was a pro bono customer from the start, and Akamai and its sister company Prolexic have stood by me through countless attacks over the past four years. It just so happened that this last siege was nearly twice the size of the next-largest attack they had ever seen before. Once it became evident that the assault was beginning to cause problems for the company’s paying customers, they explained that the choice to let my site go was a business decision, pure and simple.</p><p>Protecting Krebs is a big win for Project Shield, a p</p>",

    "content": "<p>And I honestly don’t think these things should be reviewed at all — especially as a gadget. More of a hybrid marketing/consumer research experiment than an actual product launch, Snap, née Snapchat, Spectacles are one of the coolest, most fun bits of hardware I’ve used lately and I just scored an NES Classic.</p><p>But they’re not a full rollout of a hardware product. Reviewing these would be tantamount to reviewing one of those pop out pairs of 3D glasses that come inside a Blu-Ray case for some tentpole flick. Not that the hardware isn’t interesting or well designed in its own way, but they’re being dropped out by dribs and drabs in the few thousands of pairs and are a limited edition product. This product and the marketing effort around it will establish Snap as a company that exists outside of Snapchat, its software product — and it will tell Snap how people use them and what for, exactly.</p><p>But they’re still worth examining, for the same reasons I mentioned above.</p><p>As an establishing force, the Spectacles are a solid win. There was huge hype over their release in a vending machine designed to look like a character out of Snap’s ‘universe’ — a cartoony eyeball sporting Minion box with a clever Augmented Reality try-on screen and whimsical details like a rainbow printed receipt with a binary code message at the bottom. You can read more about the experience of using the machine here. Early impressions, including this one, are good.</p><p>With huge lines in its first location (it’s coming to more places soon) in Venice Beach, CA near Snap HQ, the buzz was instant and fierce. Pairs of Snap glasses are going for thousands on eBay because the demand far outstrips the supply. Already, this limited rollout pays dividends as it avoids pairs sitting on shelves somewhere and creates a marketing event around even their appearance. Snap avoided sending the glasses to gadget or tech sites for review, which I’ve already said I think is a great idea. That’s not where these things will be sold — that will be accomplished via the hype and their output, which exists only on Snapchat in the form of clever circular video.</p><p>It’s a product that produces content only for its exact intended purchasing audience. This is an incredibly difficult feat to pull off. Even Apple, with its incredible history of great iPhone cameras has to appeal to a wide audience of potential buyers that may be using photos or videos on dozens of different platforms.</p><p>Snap has inverted the hardware funnel here in a way that I haven’t seen since the Flip camera (RIP, dead before your time).</p><p>The glasses themselves are a Ray-Ban analogue but with some design twists that remind me more of my favorite pair from Ksubi, the Bonde. Size wise they are closer to a 54mm Wayfarer – big on the face but not out of trend. The two yellow circles for camera and LED ‘recording’ light balance out the front, making the camera a design element rather than letting it fall into the realm of ‘technical necessity’. The four circles of the two lenses and the two yellow circles give the glasses a radically distinct look that is recognizable from a distance — another hallmark of great marketing design.</p><p>The packaging and accessories are, more than anything, disarming. It’s the egg foam that cuts that heavy pour New York Sour.  The sweet cream that makes that acidy store bought cold brew palatable. A fun foamy case that charges the glasses to full four times and can sync snaps over to your phone with a button. A cleaning cloth cut into the shape of the Snap ghost. A multicolored USB cable wrapped in bright yellow packaging.</p><p>All of it tucked into a plastic canister that feels like it could hold tennis balls or an inflatable coozie. The whole thing evokes sun, croakies, beaches, sunblock, activewear and fun. It’s not a vibe that is going to work for everyone, some will probably feel put off by the casualness of it all. But not Snap’s core demo. And more than anything it will get attention and is completely recognizable as a Snap product.</p><p>It’s a packaging design coup that makes ‘unboxing’ feel fun again — something I haven’t felt in a long time even from the undisputed masters of packaging design like Apple.</p><p>The glasses even pair in a logical way for a Snap product. You just flip them open and snap a picture of your Snap code on the screen of your phone. This is both easy and logically aligned with Snap’s ‘universe’.</p><p>To record, you tap once for 10 seconds and twice more to extend the recording up to 30 seconds. A rotating LED on the front very clearly indicates recording — which should help reduce the creep factor just as much as the highly recognizable yellow rings and manual gesture to start recording.</p><p>The experience isn’t without its glitches. The glasses did drop Bluetooth connection at very short ranges and the transfer of snaps is too slow. Even the WiFi mode, manually enabled, for transferring ‘HD’ snaps is not all that zippy. But overall, it works as advertised.</p><p>More than anything else here, though, the circular video is a revelation. When shot with Spectacles and displayed in your camera roll, it’s a circular disc. When viewed in Snapchat, the video fills the screen and as you rotate your device you get a smooth transition from vertical to horizontal, allowing you to see more of the image than if you’d just done one or the other. I only tried this on iPhone though it is available on Android as well.</p><p>There is a sort of rethinking here of what video is and is used for. The choice between vertical and horizontal stills became a moot point when video became common, then flared up again when mobile phones rolled around. With their default vertical orientation the holy war between vertical video and horizontal video shooters was born. I’ve never been particularly religious about it but almost always preferred horizontal because the intended viewing point of those videos was either a TV or a computer. Snapchat, of course, changes that because all of its video is i</p>",

    "content": "<p>My kids don’t turn off the damn lights. Ever. And now, with Curb, I have a new way to see when they leave on their lights. All I have to do is look at an app. This is the future of parenting — and, well, energy monitoring.</p><p>Curb is a comprehensive household energy monitoring system. The system monitors the entire home by using sensors installed in the circuit breaker. For many consumers this means being able to monitor the energy consumed by a clothes dryer or electric range or all the outlets and lights in a bedroom. It cannot, however, easily monitor and report how much energy is consumed by a computer or espresso machine.</p><p>I had the system installed in my house over a month ago. It took licensed electrician about three hours. He had to install a sensor on each breaker and configure the system through an iPad app. This is not something an average homeowner can install themselves and that’s kind of the point.</p><p>Curb aims to serve a homeowner with data not previously available. Other energy monitoring services either monitor the entire home or individual outlets. Curb sits in the middle of the two at the circuit break box. Each breaker gets a sensor and an app can display real-time consumption information as well as a dollar approximation of how much the energy is costing the homeowner.</p><p>The data can be revealing and now I don’t ever want to use my electric clothes dryer again.</p><p>In the graphic above, you can see a few things. The yellow line at the bottom a basement circuit which powers a cable modem, file server and networking equipment. It never goes off. That circuit also powers the lights in the basement, where were used for family time just before 7:00PM. The large dark blue spikes are the electric clothes dryer. It’s brand new, too!</p><p>Just after 7:00PM on the chart, you can see when the stove was used and then again just before 11:00am (that’s when I made some eggs). Other highlights include the light green which is the other basement circuit. This was used just prior to 7:00PM for a movie with the kids and then again at 9:00 AM for a quick workout.</p><p>In this chart, you can see the circuit that powers my son’s room. He went to bed around 9:45, but apparently had on several lights nonstop starting around 4:00 even though I know he wasn’t in his room during that time. He’s the worst.</p><p>But what do I do with all this data? That’s where the system stops being useful. Obviously I can stop using my electric dryer and hang the clothes outside. Or teach my kids to turn off their lights. But I need help from there.</p><p>The system should be able to display more historical data. Right now all it can do is show how much energy a particular circuit consumed — but now a total amount of watts. It can show how much power a home has consumed over a set of dates and also what the average was during that period. But what about the individual circuits? I want the system to let me dial down to a granule level.</p><p>The web and smartphone app are basic at this point. The founder tells me the company is working towards implementing new features. The team is also playing with weekly emails that gives the consumer a breakdown of their energy usage and if anything abnormal occurred. Apparently, according to him, the system can identify when an appliance is consuming extra electricity, which could be a sign that it is nearing the end of its life.</p><p>Currently, just after launch, the user experience of Curb leaves me wanting more. It is collecting so much information about my energy usage yet I feel it’s not benefiting me in a major way. Of course I should use appliances less.</p><p>Yet the system shows a lot of promise in surprising ways.</p><p>A few weeks family and I were standing in line for the Easter Bunny. This was the day before Easter so we were in line for over an hour. And like any good parent, I spent the time putzing around on my phone. Mindlessly, I opened the Curb app and discovered the stove was drawing power though I thought I had turned if off. I texted my neighbor who went over and discovered the oven was still on.</p><p>Curb hails from Austin, Texas where a small team built the product. The company acquired $117,000 in preorders and pledges through an Indiegogo campaign and later went on to raise $1.25 million in seed funding from angels, strategic partners and Austin’s Capital Factory.</p><p>Currently Curb is available through Indiegogo and Amazon. The company has sold just less than a thousand units and are working with electricians to get these systems installed. Alternatively, Curb is talking with solar power providers to use the Curb system to monitor the energy output of panels while also providing the deep energy usage data.</p><p>Data is power and Curb has the potential to radically change how consumers use their electricity output. At the moment the system is rather basic and only provides a high level overview but hopefully as the company grows and expands, capabilities are added and new insights are gained.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Silicon Valley “tech bubble” is a popular topic of discussion among business pundits, entrepreneurs and analysts who have dissected and predicted the upcoming “burst” for nearly the last decade. For all the talk of winter is coming and a slowdown in private capital markets, it’s hard to say if, or when, this will ever come to a head — at least in Silicon Valley.</p><p>But there’s no question a tech bubble is emerging, just not where you might think.</p><p>Overvalued startups focused on growth over revenue are a problem that stretches far beyond U. S. borders, and it’s an even bigger problem in India. Granted, a tech bubble bursting in India isn’t going to send shock waves through the ecosystem worldwide, let alone the public markets in that country, as it would in the U.S. However, it will impact the pace of innovation and investor risk appetite in the short-term in India and other emerging markets (other than China, the behemoth outlier) who share similar market characteristics (like Brazil, Indonesia and Nigeria).</p><p>The successes — or failures — from what works for the Indian consumer in their home market translates to the rest of the world significantly more so than following the successful models of companies like Alibaba, Tencent and others in China. Even if you don’t care about other emerging markets, experts agree India will soon be the most important economy in the world.</p><p>Much of India’s future success depends on whether the government can leverage its demographic potential by training its workforce and providing adequate infrastructure for businesses. This challenge is compounded by where the growth in mobile consumers is occurring. According to The Economist, India will see more people come online in the next 15 years than any other country, with the majority of that growth coming from rural, not urban areas.</p><p>These new mobile consumers will generally be poorer and lack the purchasing power needed to support a booming tech sector. While India’s internet and smartphone penetration is growing incredibly fast, this does not directly translate either into users having the ability to buy voraciously like their Chinese counterparts or new companies able to deliver goods in a timely fashion to rural communities.</p><p>More to the point, mobile data plans in India, like other emerging markets, do not make the robust use of the internet possible for the vast majority of people. That is not a simple problem to fix, but it is certainly easier to resolve than trying to improve livelihoods and logistics from the top down. Plus, the regulatory context in the country leaves a lot to be desired — just ask Facebook about “digital colonialism” related to its “Free Basics” initiative.</p><p>Morgan Stanley released a report earlier this year estimating e-commerce sales in India of $119 billion in 2020 — a seven-fold increase from its 2015 prediction. Travel is expected to account for 60 percent or more of e-commerce, with electronics coming in at 30 percent, according to the Boston Consulting Group and Retailers Association of India. A four- to seven-fold increase in market size does not seem too crazy — until you pair it with e-commerce startup valuations in India.</p><p>Look at the top e-commerce company in India — Flipkart, most recently valued at $15 billion. That is just shy of Morgan Stanley’s estimate for the entire e-commerce market in the country, and does not even include the next two competitors, Snapdeal and Amazon India. Flipkart has approximately 45 percent market share, which means the company should have roughly $7 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) in 2015 using Morgan Stanley’s calculations. So the company is basically valued at more than two times its GMV. But GMV is not sales or revenue to Flipkart; it is total sales of online products.</p><p>Another reason for the flood of investment into India is the fear of missing out — or FOMO.</p><p>Flipkart likely takes a nominal revenue share or take rate like Amazon does, but they also must shoulder significant user acquisition costs, meaning they are losing money on every transaction for the foreseeable future. Granted, this is not unlike Amazon’s past strategy, but Amazon was never valued at equal to the entire market’s value either. Add on the fact that approximately 40 percent of the market is non-travel and you have to wonder how these numbers add up. It is no surprise that Flipkart saw its valuation marked down by almost a quarter by three fund investors.</p><p>Another reason for the flood of investment into India is the fear of missing out — or FOMO — on something akin to China’s enormous success. In one camp, you have investors Napster and Softbank whose portfolios include very successful bets in the Chinese and Indian markets (JD.com, Tencent and Flipkart for Napster, and Alibaba and Snapdeal for Softbank). In the other camp, you have the investors like Amazon who misfired on Chinese growth and do not want to repeat past mistakes. Beyond that, there are local and international VC firms like Sequoia and Accel, as well as more opportunistic investors like Tiger Global that sense opportunity and do not want to be left out.</p><p>So what does this mean for the other unicorns in India? Investment in Indian startups decreased in the first half of 2016 to $2.1 billion, a 40 percent decline from the same period in 2015, when startups raised $3.5 billion. Anecdotally, it seems as though this retrenchment is not due to a reassessment of the startups in question but is part of a global reassessment of investor appetite for tech startups worldwide. It is likely that market leaders like Flipkart, Ola and others will get devalued markedly, but will continue to receive investor interest due to FOMO.</p><p>Naspers' PayU buys Citrus Pay for $130M in cash to expand in India</p><p>Marketing and optimization startup Zarget raises $6M</p><p>Houzz comes to India</p><p>This Indian team plans to be the first private company to land on the moon</p><p>This does not portend well for the rest of Indian startups </p>",

Startup founders are struggling to instill confidence among employees that the culture of openness at their companies will not be affected by a President Trump.</p><p>Unfortunately, some media outlets aren’t helping. Earlier this evening, Fox news published that Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney had asked employees who had voted for Trump to resign. There is no evidence to back up those claims. What Maloney did was affirm a culture of openness at his company.</p><p>“I and everyone else here at Grubhub will fight for your dignity and your right to make a better life for yourself and your family here in the United States,” said Maloney in his original blog post. “If you do not agree with this statement then please reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here.”</p><p>Maloney did not specifically address Trump voters at any point in his memo, but Fox insisted on the narrative of an executive punishing employees for an undesirable political outcome. In the context of protests going on not far from the company’s Chicago headquarters, the memo helps to address fears running through a workforce of over 1,000 employees.</p><p>As reports spread, Maloney decided to publish an update on Grubhub’s blog to personally clarify that he hadn’t intended to isolate Republican voters. But of course this clarification was just a formality. It was always clear that he wanted to prevent Trump’s hateful ideas from permeating the company’s culture.</p><p>“I want to clarify that I did not ask for anyone to resign if they voted for Trump,” asserted Maloney in the updated post. “I would never make such a demand. To the contrary, the message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees.”</p><p>Maloney isn’t the first well-known tech figure to make headlines for his reaction to Trump’s upset victory. Most prominently, 500 Startups Founder Dave McClure went off on an extended, heated rant, about his frustration with Trump’s election during a talk at Web Summit. With such contrast it’s not hard to differentiate McClure’s emotional outburst from Maloney’s constructive memo.</p><p>We reached out to Maloney to see if he has anything to add and will update this post if we hear back.</p>",

    "content": "<p>There has been a bit of fussiness in publishing over the past few weeks regarding the rise of used bookstores as cultural centers/ways to screw writers. While many are coming down on the side of “any exposure, even through piracy” is good, many more writers are taking the “pay the writer” tack. The good news is that they’re both right.</p><p>First, let’s look at the history of the argument. Around Christmas the Washington Post ran an article about how used bookstores became cultural hubs in small towns and cities where cultural hubs were hard to find. This is great. A used bookstore is a swell place to drink coffee and look smart while you peruse the poetry section. A used bookstore is a boon for young writers who can use it as a hub, a space for readings, and a place to explore writing. Amazon is awful at helping you discover new writing and scrounging through an old bookstore is marginally better – but only marginally. But at least there are sometimes brownies in a bookstore.</p><p>What some writers are concerned with, however, is the idea that they make no money from used book sales. Because no royalties come from the gray market, they wager, there is no benefit to used bookstores. In short, it’s the old “F you, pay me” argument, one that is at once cogent and logical.</p><p>On the other hand we have the “exposure is important” writers who feel that getting the word out is more important than obscurity. Neil Gaiman. for example, wrote:</p><p>So both camps are correct but I worry that the first camp will soon be wrong. Here is the hard truth: the opportunity to have a books resold in a used bookstore is fading quickly. In a perfect world I’d love for a used bookstore to feature any one of my titles in all its ragged, pre-read glory. But I am not a fool. I understand that the opportunity for my books to appear in print in any great number is now over. I will publish books in ebook form and sell them in paperback as an afterthought. There is no benefit to going with a traditional publishing when I can do so much myself and save my sanity in the process.</p><p>Go ahead and read this great piece by Kristen Lamb about why authors need to get paid. She has some very strong points and I enjoyed her writing. She wrote:</p><p>￼I have no problems with people reselling books to used bookstores. I do it. I buy books from used bookstores. BUT, I also actively go out of my way to make sure writers are PAID.</p><p>Because here’s the thing. We cannot cheer that used bookstores are “socking it to Amazon” and at the same time bemoan we aren’t making any money.</p><p>We cannot collectively cheer the “return of paper books” when they are in the used form and then also cry that we can’t leave the day job because we are not being paid for our work.</p><p>We can’t promote articles like these, directing readers to outlets where we don’t make royalties and then stand mystified that no one takes our career seriously. Why are we promoting businesses who brag about not paying us? Again *head explodes*</p><p>Great stuff. Funny stuff. But take a look at her last paragraphs:</p><p>￼Make SURE you sign up for my upcoming classes! This is part of how I fund my plans for global domination. Purchase a class! Buy a book! OR ignore all that follows but DAMN sure buy all your books NEW or I WILL FIND YOU O_o ….</p><p>Remember to check out the new classes listed at W. A.N.A International. Your friends and family can get you something you need for Christmas. Social Media for Writers, Blogging for Writers, and Branding for Authors.</p><p>She is making money selling classes to writers who could, ironically, self assemble those classes at bookstores. To be clear I am amazingly pleased by this. There is enough awful writing out there that any education will help. But the very thing she is upset about – the idea that bookstores can resell your titles – presumes there are books to resell in used book stores. This will soon not be the case and print books will become artisanal objets D’art relegated to used bookstores when reading and writing will attempt to take root and blossom.</p><p>I want to pay writers all day long but our culture and many technological advances have made that an unpopular option. You are not paying to read these words – or you are paying, indirectly, through your attention – and I have been blessed to be allowed to enter so many of your heads with my scribblings. Soon all writing will reach a central inflection point when “free or cheap” becomes the norm and print is expensive. This will, in turn, reduce the number of books available to bookstores in general and used bookstores in specific. In the end, paying the author will become much easier and bookstores will snuff out like candles in he wilderness. What happens then is anyone’s guess, but it won’t be pretty.</p>",

Schiller will be leaving NBC News at year’s end and joining Twitter in January. Schiller had been rumored as the choice for Twitter’s head of news for some time, including a report from All Things D earlier this month that she was a ‘lock’ for the role.</p><p>Excited to join @Twitter as Head of News in January. Leaving @NBCNews at year’s end. Grateful to my beloved colleagues for 2+ great years.</p><p>Schiller has been at NBC Universal since 2011 and has held positions at the NYT, Discovery and NPR. Twitter began formally searching for a candidate for the position in April of this year. The original job posting noted that the person in the position would be “responsible for devising and executing the strategies that make Twitter indispensable to newsrooms and journalists, as well as an essential part of the operations and strategy of news organizations and TV news networks.”</p><p>Twitter is in the process of making sure that people continue to view it as a source for news. It’s currently experimenting with a breaking news notification account called @eventparrot and recently expanded its emergency alerts program. A large portion of Twitter’s development efforts over the past few months have been centered around big media partnerships with TV and sports organizations. But one of the earliest codified uses of Twitter beyond ‘here’s my lunch’ was breaking news. It was a natural jump from daily minutiae to daily news and then news by the minute. One of the prime early examples of this was the “just felt an earthquake” tweets that outpaced most traditional methods of alert. Twitter also began getting recommendations from governments for use during emergencies.</p><p>For some, Twitter is viewed as the biggest, most powerful unified conduit for real-time news that we have. Now, Twitter needs to convince news organizations to use it in a way that will benefit both parties. And that’s Schiller’s job.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Messaging app Tango has made further layoffs as new CEO Eric Setton continues to orchestrate changes in a bid to transform the struggling company’s fortunes.</p><p>Setton, who moved from CTO to CEO last month, split the Tango app into two — a back-to-basics messaging service and a social networking app — earlier this month. On Friday, he announced that 20 percent of Tango’s team would exit the company as part of a “new phase” for the U. S. company, which was values at over $1 billion following a $280 million Series D led by Alibaba in March 2014.</p><p>“Today we’re taking additional steps to set up Tango for long-term success by making the tough, but necessary decision to restructure the team. A recent review of our operations and finances made it clear to me that we need to align better our expenses with our revenue,” Setton said in a statement.</p><p>This restructuring is in line with planned layoffs that we reported on in January, but with one change. Tango was initially planning to shutter its office in Beijing, China, but instead it made these latest reductions from its HQ in Mountain View, including staff working on its mobile games division. Forbes reported that 50 of Tango’s 250 staff will exit, but one source told TechCrunch that the number is actually 70 and there will be reductions from the China office, too, but not right now.</p><p>“The layoffs today were in Mountain View. I don’t have anything to share about our other offices at this time,” Setton told TechCrunch when we asked whether the Beijing office would be closed.</p><p>We reported last November that Tango quietly let nearly 9 percent of its workforce go after it closed down its e-commerce service, which was launched in partnership with Walmart and Alibaba barely six months earlier.</p><p>Tango’s company culture reached a toxic crescendo last year — that was one factor that led to then CEO Uri Raz being replaced by Setton, alongside mismanagement and question marks around previous funding rounds — and there’s concern that these layoffs could trigger problems again. A long-time TechCrunch source inside Tango told us that, with Monday a national holiday, many of the staff affected by the layoffs took a long holiday and weren’t present in the office to hear the announcement first-hand.</p><p>In a company blog post, Setton acknowledged that Tango needs to be “nimble” to take on its much larger rivals, and with the messaging industry now dominated by a handful of powerful players, he has his work cut out re-establishing Tango and its service, which enjoyed a meteoric rise when it burst on the scene as one of the first cross-platform video calling apps.</p><p>Tango claims 350 million registered users, of which 48.5 million were active each month as of October 2015, according to internal documents reviewed by TechCrunch. That’s compared to one billion active WhatsApp users, 800 million active Facebook Messenger users, 650 million WeChat active users, 215 million active Line users, to name but a few competing apps. There’s also Apple’s iMessage and the humble SMS, which compete with all chat apps.</p><p>Setton told Forbes that Tango still has half of the money from its Series D in the bank, so, with these new cost reductions, it seems like Tango isn’t about to go out of business any time soon. Setton and his team will no doubt be back to the drawing board for new ideas to spur a turnaround.</p>",

    "content": "<p>In the scramble to build bots that live up to the hype, messaging app Telegram has just announced a $1M giveaway to developers to try to incentivize them to build cool stuff. The messaging startup launched its own bot platform back in June last year, long before Facebook started its photocopiers in case you’re keeping count.</p><p>The Telegram botprize will not go to one mega-useful bot but will rather be distributed as a series of grants, starting at $25,000, to the bot devs whose wares impress, according to details in a Telegram blog post outlining the competition.</p><p>It adds that the prize money will be distributed “in several batches” throughout the year, with the final deadline being December 31.</p><p>And Telegram’s criteria for building great bots? Basically, be fast and be useful.</p><p>Which, at this nascent stage of the bot hypelifecycle, is already looking like a challenge. Early reviews of Facebook bots, for example, have been far from complimentary.</p><p>“Frustrating, disappointing and far less efficient than visiting the company website” was the verdict of TC’s own Sarah Perez on testing out the bots Facebook featured in its f8 presentation where it launched its big bot push. And she’s not the only critic, either.</p><p>The fast-forming suspicion, then, is that a chatty messaging interface is merely the latest disguise to cloak the unwelcome, gelatinous and indubitably familiar visage of spam spam spam.</p><p>And especially sticky spam, given how apparently difficult it can be to extricate yourself from a prior bot embrace. Invite bots into your messaging life with caution, then.</p><p>Given the risk of users being switched off bots double quick — i.e. if they perceive that inviting a robot interlocutor over their messaging threshold will merely result in a deluge of annoying upsell — little wonder Telegram is attempting to steer the conversation in a more consumer friendly direction.</p><p>“Some areas you may want to focus on: integrations, tools for bot builders, AI stuff, and natural language processing, although your bot may do something altogether different. Surprise us!” it adds.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Telegram is also seeking to encourage developers to build bots that feel like they are native to its platform. So although the competition does extend to ported bots, Telegram stresses developers should “make sure it really feels at home in Telegram”.</p><p>“We have many nifty interface options that aren’t available elsewhere and make using Telegram bots a breeze,” it adds.</p><p>Some examples of existing Telegram bots include a bot that lets you search for related stickers based on a particular emoji; a bot that lets you search for and share YouTube videos without having to leave a messaging thread; and a bot that lets you search for classical music by keyword, and share a music file to your conversation. These three bots were built by Telegram as examples of the sorts of things third party developers can do with its bot platform.</p><p>The free-to-use messaging app is not taking any revenue at this point, and is reported to be funded by the personal wealth of millionaire founder and Russian-born entrepreneur Pavel Durov — a little more of which is now evidently going towards incentivizing developers to build bots.</p><p>When Durov launched the messaging app in fall 2013 he told TechCrunch his intention was for the app to remain non-profit to avoid commercial and legal pressure. That ethos may allow bots on Telegram to be a little less nakedly commercial vs bots on other platforms, at least initially. Albeit it remains to be seen what developers will be encouraged to build for Telegram.</p><p>Back in February, Telegram announced it had passed the 100M monthly active users mark. Earlier this month, announcing the first major update to its bot platform since launch, Durov told TechCrunch more than a fifth of monthly users now view content generated by bots — so that’s some 20 million Telegram users regularly engaging with robots.</p><p>Asked how many bots there are on the Telegram platform now, Durov could not provide a figure — saying only that there are “countless” because it’s an open platform and anyone can launch one. But he did add that “most of them don’t have many users”.</p><p>“We’ve been studying what developers were doing on our platform since its launch. So we’ve gathered some knowledge about what kinds of bots are useful and what kind of bots are not. Now we want to share this knowledge with the ecosystem through BotPrizes and encourage the development of great bots with grants and larger exposure,” he told TechCrunch.</p><p>“I’d like to see more integrations with services. For example, I’d use a bot that would forward me emails from my gmail account (and allow me to reply to them from Telegram),” he adds. “Or a bot from my bank, that would send me updates from my bank account and allow to quickly check balance. In short, useful stuff.”</p><p>Durov said popular bots on Telegram at this nascent stage are bots that allow you to find/create other bots, naming the likes of @storebot and @chatfuelbot. So at least some of the early interest in bots is evidently being fueled by developers thinking about creating their own bots.</p><p>But he added that inline bots such as @gif, @bing and @youtube are “predictably popular” too.</p>",

Many have been complaining on Twitter about the problem, posting screenshots that show the channel’s disappearance while tweeting at Comcast-run Twitter accounts for answers.</p><p>The company tells TechCrunch that the problem was due to a glitch with its programming guide.</p><p>“Earlier today, a few TV channels in some markets were temporarily unavailable. We received inaccurate data from the vendor who provides our programming guide data, which caused this temporary interruption. The vendor has corrected this, and most channels have already been restored. We expect any remaining channels to be available momentarily. We apologize for the inconvenience and are working with the vendor to prevent this from happening again.”</p><p>We understand that this problem began overnight, though the exact time has yet to be determined.

S.</p><p>NBC wasn’t the only channel affected, either – only the most high-profile one. Other channels that disappeared included some broadcast affiliates and independent channels.</p><p>The issue was due to inaccurate data sent to Comcast by one of its vendors who provide the information for its programming guide. The vendor itself hasn’t yet determined what caused the issue on its end – it could be technical or even human error.</p><p>But the problem was, basically, a data glitch, and not a heavy-handed contract negotiation ploy that providers sometimes engage in, as Time Warner did by pulling Disney-owned ABC over a decade ago.</p><p>However, the timing itself is unfortunate, given it’s Election Day in the U. S., and Comcast/NBC Universal has even been the subject of Trump’s speeches in recent days.</p><p>Comcast serves 22.4 million pay TV subscribers in the U. S., but the issue only impacted a subset of those customers.</p><p>The missing channels are now coming back online, and the problem should be resolved in minutes for the remaining impacted customers.</p>",

S.-Japanese IPO last Friday following aborted efforts in 2014 and 2015, thereby opening some of its previously tightly guarded financial information to public eyes.</p><p>It’s not an overstatement to say that Line has single-handedly pioneered stickers, which are now a fairly staple part of most social apps. But, beyond being cute, they generated the company an altogether-not-too-shabby JPY 28,725 million ($271 million) in revenue in 2015 — that’s up 38 percent on the previous year.</p><p>It’s also more than double the already impressive $10 million that the company was banking in 2013, and it accounts for around one-quarter of Line’s total sales. That’s important since Line is dependent on Japan for nearly 90 percent of its revenue, and stickers have appeal outside of the country and among more casual users. Indeed, Line said that its users send an average of 389 million stickers — paid and free — each day, that’s around nine percent of the total number of messages sent on the service daily.</p><p>Stickers aren’t the only surprising form of income for Line: the company also disclosed that it made over JPY 2 billion ($18.8 million) from sales of merchandising and licensing deals last year for its Line characters, the figures who star in its sticker packs and front its brand. That’s double the 2014 figure.</p><p>Characters like Brown the mute but caring bear and impulsive, emotional figure Moon have made the leap from chat app to small screen via a TV show that started out in Line’s native Japan but have been exported worldwide. But Line also cashes in on its faces through a number of physical stores in Asia and beyond — such as the one we visited in Korea — that sell all manner of merchandising, from mugs, to pillows, plush dolls and actual physical stickers.</p><p>Together, the stickers and merchandising account for nearly one-third of Line’s total revenue, but they also help put a face on the app which the company thinks can help it win new markets. It remains to be seen if now, in the year 2016 with the messaging space long matured, whether dislodging a chat app in a country is even possible, but Line certainly has a strong brand which could resonate among other parts of Asia, where most of its 215 million active users are based.</p><p>Ultimately Line makes most of its money through focused advertising and games and it hasn’t broken even yet.

Details have been hard to come by, but the group was hiring researchers for a short time on the tail end of the summer. In a blog post, Huh explained his intentions to make a real difference in the world with his upcoming work.</p><p>It appears YC is serious about leaving behind prior notions and best practices of urban development in their quest to disrupt. Huh, something of a meme mogul, is coming off a long term role as CEO of a company that facilitated the creation and sharing of internet memes. Huh left Cheezburger in 2015 noting how much of a “marathon” the eight year effort had been. In today’s post, Huh connected his experiences traveling during a gap year to his renewed drive to tackle hard problems.</p><p>While the aim of the New Cities effort was almost certainly to inspire, the project’s announcement earlier this summer was met with criticism from many who poked fun at the initiative for trivializing the work of urban planners, whose job is to manage land use and plan next generation infrastructure.</p><p>In true startup fashion, the group has an application open for location referrals to potentially optimal locations for a new experimental metropolis. The form asks for information on zoning restrictions and immigration rules for the site. It also leaves room for a breakdown of costs if YC makes use of the location.</p><p>Huh’s role is being described as that of an “explorer.” He is only set to be involved in the future cities project for the next six months, which seems like an awfully short time horizon for a problem Altman noted could take “a long time,” perhaps even “25 years,” to address.</p><p>To critics, Huh’s post screams of a particular Silicon Valley savior ethos. The attitude can roughly be explained as a belief that private enterprise, unencumbered by the chains of bureaucracy, can execute public service better than the government itself.</p><p>Sam Altman himself, President of the YC Group, donated $10 million to form the research arm that gave birth to the New Cities project in addition to work around openAI, basic income, and human advancement. In YC’s initial blog post, Altman and Adora Cheung, a YC Partner tasked with initiating New City efforts, included an almost comical footnote addressing this potential criticism head on.</p><p>“We’re not interested in building “crazy libertarian utopias for techies,” the two clarified.</p><p>However, today’s post from Huh remains quite focused on problems likely to be on the forefront of the minds of “techies” in places like San Francisco and New York City.</p><p>“Housing prices in urban environments have skyrocketed due to poor policy decisions and NIMBY-ism,” noted Huh.</p><p>There is a lot of nuance required when addressing NIMBY-ism and its part in today’s urban challenges. Huh is not explicitly wrong so much as narrow in addressing many of the challenges faced by cities not caught in the waves of economic prosperity. Detroit for example may have inclusivity issues, but blight and vacancy are what occupy the thoughts of residents on a daily basis.</p><p>That isn’t to say starting from scratch is always bad — diversity of approach can and often does lead to positive unexpected outcomes. It is simply up to Y Combinator to disclose additional details on the exact end game of its efforts.</p>",

While the music seems to be back on at the IPO party, aspects of the private market re-calibration may be permanent.

This message reverberated across Silicon Valley, where companies were advised to decrease burn and show sustainability by demonstrating an ability to make money.</p><p>Tech multiples, which compressed significantly at the beginning of the year, have recovered, but not to levels as lofty as early 2015:</p><p>Two months ago, the general consensus was that the IPO market would shut down until at least 2017 — essentially 17 months with almost no IPO deal flow.</p><p>June 22, 2016, Twilio (TWLO) priced at $15 (a healthy premium to the last private round) and traded up 92 percent day 1. Since then, TWLO has traded up 278 percent and the IPO window has opened wide.</p><p>Just like that, IPOs are back in favor… all fear evaporated, all hesitation erased without any resolution to the supposed issues that precipitated the pullback originally. Perhaps all anyone needed was a breather in the shape of the most severe IPO drought since the recession.</p><p>Private company fundings followed the IPO market’s lead dropping from 1,333 in Q3 2015 to 1,137 in Q4. Deal volume stayed suppressed through Q2 2016, and this year is on pace to be slower than 2012.</p><p>Dollars raised in 2016 versus 2015, but not as significantly as deals quantity; fewer deals for larger dollars were done for the biggest and best private companies.</p><p>As the IPO market cooled, private funding showed an even more severe and immediate flight to quality. Uber and Snap alone account for $4.5 billion of the $31.8 billion in U. S. VC-backed financing in 2016. High-flyers like Slack, Airbnb and Spotify also commanded sizable rounds at, often, sizable prices.</p><p>Select innovative sub-sectors, such as artificial intelligence, insurance tech, autonomous driving and virtual reality also saw demand and excitement in line with early 2015 levels. Otherwise, venture investors have returned to more cautious, diligence-focused investing, as they had before unicorn euphoria hit, and with the complete retreat of crossover investors, venture remains largely a buyer’s market.</p><p>The bias toward proven stories has led to a significant decrease in the number of unicorns created in 2016. Twelve unicorns were created in the first two quarters of the year, compared to 49 in Q2 and Q3 of 2015.</p><p>With stocks touching all-time highs, and IPOs once again coming to market (and performing), the public market recovery is clear. Banks have said the IPO market will remain extremely active through the end of the year and into 2017.</p><p>The cracks in venture can’t be repaired that quickly. Renewed VC prudence hasn’t slowed down innovation, but it has slowed getting that innovation through the funding machine.</p><p>There has been a meaningful shift in VC interest in a company’s technology to the company itself. VC investors want to see infrastructure, track record and reliability, not just the next big idea. The rhetoric of “tell me how you are going to become the next billion-dollar business” has turned into “tell me how you are going to make this a sustainable business.”</p><p>So the large, clear winners still attract a buying frenzy, but it has become much harder for most companies, especially smaller companies, to raise. However, opportunity is knocking for VCs willing to go against the grain that have now been given more time and pricing power to selectively uncover the next unicorn.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Throughout history, every form of communication has developed its own shorthand.</p><p>Northern Renaissance paintings were rich in symbolism; even the most mundane detail, like a vase, was a rich allegory.</p><p>Victorians folded the corners of their calling cards to express sentiments ranging from congratulations to condolences.</p><p>Wireless telegraphists developed a system of coded slang to save their hands from the dreaded “morse finger.”</p><p>And now Line, a messaging app with 205 million monthly active users around the world, has stickers like this:</p><p>I live in Taiwan, where many WhatsApp users switched to WeChat and Line about three years ago, thanks in large part to stickers and emojis. At first I thought stickers were pointless—why waste time flipping through a library of cutesy pictures when you can type a response in seconds?</p><p>Then I saw that twisted party sticker above and realized I was wrong. Like symbols in Renaissance paintings, Line stickers express a wide, complex, and often bemusing array of ideas and emotions–and some are just really messed up, in an awesome way.</p><p>Line is spending a lot of money to transform its messaging app into a “lifestyle platform” filled with features like grocery deliveries and streaming music. Similar to strategies taken by other messaging apps like WeChat, KakaoTalk, and, more recently, Facebook Messenger, offering a wide range of services is meant to keep users engaged even after the novelty of free texting and voice calls wear off.</p><p>Line messaging app’s main sources of revenue, however, are still sticker packs and games. Its Creator’s Market, which lets third-party designers upload and sell stickers, made $75 million during its first year in business.</p><p>According to figures the company released for its fourth anniversary last month, up to 2.4 billion stickers and emojis are sent each day by its users. Almost half, or 48 percent, express happiness, but the rest reflect emotions ranging from sadness (10 percent) to anger (6 percent) and surprise (5 percent).</p><p>Many people in the U. S. and other Western countries make the same mistake I did of assuming that messaging app stickers are just cute. In a recent article about the Line’s initial public offering plans, Bloomberg referred to them as “teddy bear icons.”</p><p>Many of the Tokyo-based company’s stickers, however, tap into kimo-kawaii, a trend that combines kawaii, or cuteness, with darker emotions (“kimo” means gross or off-putting). Perhaps the best example of this is a series in which Moon, one of Line’s staple characters, sinks into a nadir while looking for a new job. As his bank balance dwindles to zero, Moon lets his apartment descend into squalor, passes time by watching what appears to be softcore porn, and attempts to make friends with a cockroach.</p><p>While kimo-kawaii is often described as a recent trend, it has deep roots in Japanese pop culture. A character called Gloomy Bear was designed as a blood-soaked response to Hello Kitty, but newer Sanrio characters like Gudetama, a chronically depressed egg, also tap into kimo-kawaii.</p><p>Questions remain about how well Line’s appeal will translate outside of its core markets, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia, which account for more than half it users, especially as it preps for an initial public offering.</p><p>No matter how its business strategies perform, however, Line’s stickers are an example of how tech companies can influence and reinforce cultural trends, as characters created to sell a product take on a life of their own.</p><p>Like other designs that encapsulate kimo-kawaii, Line characters have an edge made palatable by their cuteness. Most—a brown teddy bear, a white rabbit, a green frog, a yellow chick—are like a crayon box filled with generic prototypes of cartoon characters. This makes them highly versatile.</p><p>In a sticker pack, they might be engaging in bloodsport or forcefeeding each other cake, but in Line Friends stores, which have been set up in in the company’s main markets to sell stuffed animals, stationery, dishware, and other items, they appear as harmless as Hello Kitty.</p><p>Line’s data records which stickers get used the most often, but not how recipients react to them. This presents a challenge, but also gives its designers more freedom. The company doesn’t have a specific demographic in mind when creating new packs. When Line first launched, however, the majority of its users were female high school students, says Naotomo Watanabe, the manager of Line’s sticker planning team in Tokyo.</p><p>As the app sought to widen its appeal, it began to expand its market tests to other groups. “Moon’s Job Hunting Story” was created for release in early spring, which marks the beginning of the fiscal year in Japan when many professionals are looking for new job opportunities.</p><p>Line, which now offers 140,000 sticker sets and 6,830 emoji, is busy figuring out how to monetize its characters in countries where its messaging app has not achieved dominance. For example, it recently launched Emoji Keyboard, which is targeted to users outside of Asia. The keyboard is packed with 3,000 stickers and emojis and, if it is successful, might attract people to other Line apps, including aillis (formerly called Line camera), its photo-editing app, games like Line Rangers, and even utility apps like Line Antivirus and Line Tools.</p><p>In a text conversation, stickers are bids for connection that take even less effort than gifs or emoticons. They make it easy to express feelings you can’t (and probably shouldn’t) spell out in words.</p><p>Other messaging apps with stickers that capture the essence of kimo-kawaii include Facebook’s Sinister Oyster and HamCat packs.</p><p>Line’s stickers stand out, however, because they feature a group of characters with storylines that are relatively complicated—or at least substantial enough to provide fodder for a cartoon series called “Line Town” and manga series. To be sure, some of Line’s sticker packs are cute in a straightforward way, like “Brown and Con</p>",

    "content": "<p>If you’re like me your inbox is a mess of hundreds of promotional emails from different sites across the web – many of which I’ve only actually shopped at once or twice. But once they have your email address it’s over – you can expect to receive a weekly (or daily!) email ad infinitum.</p><p>Companies that get your cell phone number are even worse because those are harder to figure out how to unsubscribe from. And what about merchants that get your credit card info and charge you each month even though they didn’t make it clear it was a reoccurring charge?</p><p>The moral of the story is that unless you proactively work to use one-time email addresses and debit cards when you shop online, you’re going to eventually have a problem on your hands. But doing this is hard, and typically requires too much effort and technical knowledge for the average consumer to do.</p><p>Enter SudoApp and SudoPay. The duo of apps created by Anonyome Labs allow users to create and delete temporary (or permanent) identities. Each of these identities come with a customizable name, email address and phone number.</p><p>All communication happens inside the app – each persona you create will have an inbox with emails and threaded SMS messages – just like you were checking them on your own phone.</p><p>The app also has a web browser with built in ad-blocking and private browsing in case you want to go the extra mile to maintain privacy.</p><p>And if you’re worried about credit card fraud the company’s second app, SudoPay, allows you to create one-time or multi-use prepaid debit card that you can use along with any of your identities. SudoPay lets you load these cards with Apple Pay, so your real credit card isn’t at all connected to the prepaid cards.</p><p>Steve Shillingford, founder and CEO of the company, explained that SudoApp is targeting two main types of customers. The first is what you’d expect – someone very interested in technology that cares about their privacy. These may have been people that had previously used disposable email addresses and phone numbers but were attracted to SudoApp because of how much easier it is to use then managing identities on your own.</p><p>The second type of user is a little more interesting. Shillingford described them as a “chief household officer” – essentially a mom or dad that has many different parts of their life they need to organize and keep separate. So these users create a different identity (all with their real name but new email and phone numbers) for the soccer team, work, school mailing list…etc.</p><p>As mentioned earlier disposable emails, phone numbers and prepaid cards aren’t new. But Sudo does a good job at bringing them all together two easy to use apps.</p><p>It’s also very affordable – users can create 9 identities for free, which includes unlimited calling and texting and 1 GB of email. The prepaid card services charges a dollar each time you reload a virtual card, depending on the amount of the reload.</p><p>So far the company has been entirely self-funded, but the founders expect to raise their first round of outside funding sometime in 2017.</p><p>Both SudoApp and SudoPay are available now for iOS.</p>",

    "content": "<p>It’s bad news for Yahoo. The company is in the midst of finalizing its sale to Verizon, but recent revelations about hacking and spying may be costing them a pretty penny.</p><p>A story from the New York Post alleges that Verizon is now asking Yahoo for a hefty $1 billion discount to finalize what was supposed to be a $4.8 billion deal. (Full disclosure: TechCrunch is owned by Verizon, although we do not have any inside knowledge about this).</p><p>“The key will be what was actually disclosed by Yahoo before signing,” Frank Aquila, legendary M&A lawyer and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell tells TechCrunch. “No one should be surprised that Verizon wants a significant reduction.”</p><p>Yahoo confirmed in September that it had suffered a data breach affecting at least 500 million users. Information, including names, email addresses, birth dates, encrypted passwords and both encrypted and decrypted answers to security questions, were stolen in the breach, which Yahoo blamed on a state-sponsored attacker. Although the stolen passwords were encrypted, the additional information could easily be reused across other websites in identity-theft schemes.</p><p>The breach occurred in 2014, but Yahoo discovered the intrusion more recently. The exact timing of Yahoo’s discovery could impact the Verizon deal. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer reportedly learned of the breach as early as July, when the sale of the company was still being negotiated. In August, Yahoo told TechCrunch in a statement that it was aware of rumors that the company had been hit by hackers and that its security team was investigating. But in a September proxy statement made as part of the sale, Yahoo claimed that there had been no third-party claims of such a breach.</p><p>Senator Mark Warner has called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Yahoo’s representations about cybersecurity. “Yahoo’s September filing asserting lack of knowledge of security incidents involving its IT systems creates serious concerns about truthfulness in representations to the public,” Warner said in a statement.</p><p>But that’s not the end of Yahoo’s cyber woes. The company faced allegations this week that it scanned all of its users’ emails last year at the behest of a U. S. intelligence agency. Again, the blame for the incident has fallen on Mayer, who reportedly made the decision not to fight the intelligence agency’s request in court and ordered the mail team to create the custom mail-scanning software without informing Yahoo’s own security engineers. The surveillance was not disclosed in Yahoo’s biannual transparency report, which documents government requests for user data. Yahoo called reports of the mail-scanning program “misleading” but has not denied that it ever occurred.</p><p>Public investors have a right to know about significant events affecting the company, and it can easily be argued that these security breaches count. Verizon could make the case that these incidences hurt the value of the Yahoo brand and thus their stock.</p><p>When asked about the hack in a televised interview with CNBC last week, AOL’s Tim Armstrong said “the data thing was something new that got introduced and we’ll work through that together with” Yahoo. He added that he wants to be “protective” of the Verizon shareholders.</p><p>After ongoing rumors, the acquisition was formally announced in July. Deals like these typically take several months to close.</p><p>Verizon also acquired TechCrunch’s parent, AOL, last year for $4.4 billion.</p><p>We’ve reached out to our overlords at Verizon and they declined to comment.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A fresh chapter of the crypto wars looks to be opening up in Europe, after the French and German interior ministers took to a podium yesterday to lobby for a law change that would enable courts to demand that Internet companies decrypt data to help further criminal investigations.</p><p>So, in other words, to effectively push for end-to-end encryption to be outlawed. Yes we’ve been here before — many times.</p><p>Giving a joint press conference in Paris yesterday with German’s Thomas de Maizière, France’s interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve called for the European Commission to change the law to afford security agencies the ability to access encrypted data.</p><p>They want their proposals discussed by the European Commission at a meeting next month.</p><p>The context here is that France and Germany have suffered a spate of terrorist attacks over the past year, including a co-ordinated attack in Paris in November 2015 that killed 130; a July 2016 attack in Nice where a truck driver ploughed into crowds celebrating Bastille Day; and a stabbing in a church in Northern France that killed an elderly priest.</p><p>A series of knife attacks and a suicide bombing have also taken place in Germany over the same timeframe — purportedly carried out by Islamist terrorists. Although the significance of encrypted comms to carrying out any of these terror plots remains unclear.</p><p>The FT quotes Patrick Calvar, French homeland security chief, saying “gigabytes” of data was collected after November’s mass shooting in Paris — and that it is “often encrypted, and impossible to decipher”. The paper also notes that the Isis cell responsible for the Paris attack used WhatsApp and Telegram — two comms apps that offer end-to-end encryption. However the same Isis cell was also reported to have used unencrypted SMS in their comms.</p><p>Cazeneuve’s speech yesterday touched on various aspects of internal security, including calling for better border controls in Europe and improved information sharing between EU member states. But on encryption he framed the challenge for Europe’s democracies as a need to “armer” themselves against terrorist’s use of encryption with a legislative power to afford security agencies access to the encrypted comms apps he said terrorists are using to communicate.</p><p>While referencing the importance of encryption for lawful activity such as protecting financial transactions, Cazeneuve singled out certain comms apps that make use of end-to-end encryption as problematic for security services — name-checking the Telegram app specifically. (Although it’s worth noting that Telegram only uses e2e encryption for a ‘secret chats’ feature; other messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, have rolled out e2e encryption as the default for all comms.)</p><p>“What we are saying, however, is that exchanges more systematic operated via some applications, such as Telegram, must be able, as part of court proceedings — and I stress this — to be identified and used as evidence by the investigation and magistrates services,” said Cazeneuve [via Google Translate].</p><p>He noted that some Internet companies are co-operating with European security services that request access to their user data but flagged Telegram as a company where state security agencies have “no contact”.</p><p>The two minister are calling for the EC to legislate to enforce the same rights and obligations on operators of any telecom or Internet service offered to users in Europe, regardless of whether they are headquartered in Europe.</p><p>And for a new obligation on operators deemed uncooperative — i.e. when it comes to removing illegal content or decrypting messages for the security services on demand.</p><p>“If such legislation were passed, it would allow us, at European level, to impose obligations on operators that uncooperative disclose such to remove illegal content or decrypt messages, exclusively in the context of criminal investigations,” added Cazeneuve.</p><p>The call for decryption on demand echoes the political trajectory in the UK over the past few years, where the Conservative government has pushed to expand surveillance legislation and cement legal powers to demand decryption via legal warrant.</p><p>The UK’s Investigatory Powers bill, now progressing through the parliament’s upper chamber, includes limits on the use of end-to-end encryption that could be used to require a company to remove encryption. Or even force a comms service provider not to use end-to-end encryption to secure a future service they are developing.</p><p>Of course the basic point about end-to-end encryption is that the operator does not hold the encryption keys, so cannot decrypt data itself. But with politicians legislating for decryption on demand the legality of e2e encryption becomes undermined — and its usage imperiled.</p><p>And as myriad security experts, tech industry bodies and data protection advocates continue to point out, backdoored encryption inevitably entails security risks for all users — not just for the suspects security agencies want to target. There is no ‘golden key’ just for the security agencies.</p><p>Expressing concern at the latest Franco-German proposals, for example, the Europe director of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, Christian Borggreen, had this to say a statement: “We are worried that EU proposals can allow governments to challenge end-to-end encryption and thus threaten the security and confidentiality of Europeans’ communications.</p><p>“It is certainly understandable that some would respond to recent tragedies with backdoors and more government access.  But weakened security ultimately leaves online systems more vulnerable to all types of attacks from terrorists to hackers.  This should be a time to increase security — not weaken it.”</p><p>Meanwhile, only last month the EU’s data protection supervisor, Giovanni Buttarelli, put out an official opinion on a review of the region’s ePrivacy directive — next in line for updating, after the European parliament adopted the GDPR earlier this year — in</p>",

Developers who participate in the event will have a chance to create retail-focused mobile apps or mobile websites, with seven finalists receiving $10,000 for their ideas, and one grand-prize winner scoring a larger prize of $75,000. But most importantly comes the promise that the winner will “get to work with Target” to bring their project to life, the retailer says.</p><p>The contest is co-branded with Fast Company via its technology vertical Co. LABS, which will document the event on its website. Target is also sponsoring the “Fast Company Grill,” the restaurant and lounge area at SXSW near the Austin Convention Center.</p><p>The run-of-the-mill startup contest isn’t really ground-breaking news, but what’s interesting here, from what we’re hearing, is that this is the beginning of a more concentrated, long-term initiative at Target to work with more startups and developers.</p><p>“Target is currently focused on this opportunity to engage the developer community,” says Target’s Corporate Communications lead Eddie Baeb, with regards to Target’s future plans. “We are always looking for innovative ideas to meet the needs of our guests, but have nothing more to share at this time,” he added.</p><p>The company also clarifies that despite using the name “accelerator” to describe the upcoming effort, it’s not directly investing in any companies. Instead, the developers are participating in a contest where the winning prototype is being awarded prize money. There’s no initial batch of entrants as you would have in a more traditional incubator programs, either. This is more hackathon than accelerator, but it’s the first time the retailer has ever engaged in such a contest.</p><p>Developers participating in the event are being asked to build a native mobile application, a mobile-enabled web experience, or a mobile design of some sort. Basically, Target is looking for ideas which can be integrated into its existing apps or mobile services, the company explains. In particular, it’s looking for new ideas around social, in-store, personalization, and education.</p><p>Not coincidentally, these are some of the areas which competitor Walmart currently tackles, too, through its Silicon Valley-based think tank “Walmart Labs.” There, the retailer has experimented with ideas which have included things like a crowdsourced “get on the shelf” contest, a Facebook wish-listing app, Facebook integration on Walmart.com, a new search engine for its e-commerce site, subscription-based commerce, and more.</p><p>As the Internet continues to disrupt the operations and bottom lines of brick-and-mortar businesses like Walmart and Target – Target now price-matches Amazon year-round, for example – the companies know that they need to move more quickly than ever before to test, iterate upon and launch apps, services and new ways of doing business that can keep them in the game as consumer buying behaviors shift rapidly under their feet.</p><p>Target has already been making some moves to try new things with regards to its online and mobile operations. In January, the company has announced that six new brands would be sold exclusively through its website, including bedding (Room365 and Boho Boutique), women’s apparel (Labworks), baby clothing (Zutano Blue), and home décor (TOO by Blu Dot and MudHut). It’s reportedly working with other major retailers on a mobile payment service called Merchant Customer Exchange. And internally, it has adopted a number of social media tools.</p><p>So while Target’s new accelerator isn’t really an accelerator, it’s not surprising that the company is starting to take more of a serious interest in the innovation produced by the startup community to improve its consumer-facing applications.</p>",

It’s an interesting choice for grand prize, given Walmart’s reputation in years past for contributing to sweatshop conditions for workers in these same underdeveloped communities. Walmart shoppers do have a heart after all, not just questionable wardrobe choices, it appears.</p><p>Runners up in the contest include San Francisco-based PlateTopper, the brainchild of Michael Tseng, which transforms ordinary dinner plates into airtight storage containers. Tseng started developing the product since 2005, while at Princeton. The product is live now on Walmart.com for $19.77.</p><p>Third place winner SnapIt Eyeglass Repair Kit is perhaps a bit less sexy than storage containers (um, maybe?), but still quite practical. The invention allows eyeglass wearers to repair their frames in 30 seconds. The design uses a feeder tab to guide the tiny screws into place, which is then snapped off when the repair is complete. It, too, will be available on Walmart.com soon.</p><p>An interesting side note about how HumanKind ended up with the Grand Prize: the company turned its website (still live as of today) into a “war room” of sorts dedicated to getting contest votes by including social sharing buttons, videos, an email sign-up and embedded mini-Facebook page. (Very interesting use of Facebook in a frame, actually). The strategy worked, as all homepage visitors were encouraged to give the product a vote. Today, new visitors are now being encouraged to donate directly to the cause.</p><p>@WalmartLabs says that within the first day of contest voting, which began March 7, almost 95% of the participants received a vote via Facebook or text. The top five products were those for home improvement, personalized products, health/wellness/fitness, fashion apparel/home and outdoor home. Walmart tells us that its focus is now on getting the winners on the shelf, and that it will then evaluate options for another similar program in the future. But as of now, no decisions on that front have been made.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Regardless of your political orientation, it is hard to argue against the success of the digital media strategy that President Obama and his team implemented to engage millions of Americans over the past two terms.</p><p>Since Franklin Roosevelt’s famous radio fireside chats in the 1930s, presidents have always aimed to engage the American people by speaking directly to their hopes, dreams and fears. But President Obama was able to leverage the opportunities of digital age technologies (such as the Internet, social networks and online video streaming) to become, seemingly, the most engaging, transparent and communicative president the world has ever known, reaching audiences that ordinarily would not be paying attention.</p><p>CEOs of companies, while dealing with challenges of different scope than that of the president, are in essence trying to achieve similar goals, such as: aligning the masses behind a strategy or an initiative, communicating and explaining decisions to other stakeholders internally or publicly, encouraging individuals to work hard toward common goals, communicating confidently at times of crises, defending strategies and agendas and portraying a positive self-image.</p><p>Therefore, many CEOs and corporate communications teams could borrow a few best practices from the president, and apply these examples to their corporate communication strategies.</p><p>The most important part in jump-starting an effective video-centric communication strategy is assigning clear ownership with an adequate amount of empowerment and resources to reach video strategy goals.</p><p>The White House, for example, appointed Silicon Valley veteran Jason Goldman as the first-ever White House Chief Digital Officer, which showcased the emphasis the White House put on digital media for its overall strategy. By emphasizing the importance of video and assigning clear ownership and resources, the White House has essentially become its own media production company, using cutting-edge technology to advance the president’s agenda, policies and initiatives, such as healthcare reform.</p><p>Most enterprise customers assign the video production task to corporate communication departments, which are equipped with visionary and expert personnel, appropriate budgets and the backing of the CEO (as well as the IT department) to help them achieve their communication and engagement goals.</p><p>For previous U. S. presidents it was mostly about working with the traditional media (i.e. news agencies, TV networks, newspapers) and occasionally addressing the nation over the TV during the State of the Union, or from the White House during special occasions. Not so for President Obama.</p><p>Leading up to his last State of the Union address, which was streamed over the Internet, the White House published a series of its own videos — including one video of Obama aboard Air Force One announcing a community college tuition reform plan (8.4 million views). Additionally, they used less-traditional video communication, such as a Google Hangout session where Obama was answering questions submitted by regular people at home over video.</p><p>Such direct video-based communication worked well for Obama. Videos that support initiatives like the “It’s On Us” pledge (to prevent sexual assault on college campuses) and climate change have attracted millions of viewers and pledgers online (one video had more than 42 million views on Facebook, making it the most-watched Facebook video ever published by a U. S. government or political entity).</p><p>Similarly, corporate communication departments representing the CEO must implement a progressive video strategy that goes beyond streaming quarterly investor relations and downhill presentations. While these are crucial and must be flawlessly delivered to the global employee base, these are “table-stakes” for today’s modern internal corporate communication strategies.</p><p>Enterprise video content nowadays often includes everything from live and on-demand video addresses from senior management, to “ video fireside chats” with the CEO or other senior managers (similar to Obama’s Google Hangout sessions), to video news flashes about what is happening in the company, informational videos about new product launches, deep-dives into introducing specific departments or projects, video contests, diversity initiatives videos and many more creative projects that drive engagement and provide a back wind to the corporate pride and a feeling of being “in the loop.”</p><p>For CEOs specifically, this means using video where it drives the most value, such as promoting initiatives, communicating in crisis situations, showing transparency by sharing information openly and authentically by recording video addresses from anywhere on any topic and connecting with  employees on a personal level and recognizing them for their achievements.</p><p>In 2015 alone, White House officials posted more than 400 videos to YouTube and Vimeo; the videos have been viewed for a total of more than 174,497,605 minutes. The CEOs of America need their own enterprise video portal to engage their employees — employees who are increasingly expecting consumer-grade experiences at work.</p><p>To that end, many leading enterprises deploy internal video portals where all communication videos are centrally hosted, accessible by all employees with varying permissions levels, segregated into channels and categories and where all content is easily searchable — which is very similar to the way it is on Vimeo and YouTube, only with the addition of enterprise-grade capabilities such as SSO integration and tight security.</p><p>Such portals are extremely effective for communication and knowledge sharing, not only for the CEO and senior management, but also for the entire organization, where departments like training, HR, Sales, Finance and IT all have found unique use cases to drive their day-to-day business with video.</p><p>Obama’s digital strategy team is using all social venues possible — including YouTube, Vimeo, Fac</p>",

The intern event, held at Parc 55 in San Francisco, had attracted representatives from some of the biggest names in the industry: Apple, Airbnb, Palantir, Andreesen Horowitz and dozens of others. It also hosted a group of speakers, consisting of billionaires, founders, CEOs and venture capitalists, that imparted their wisdom to the next generation of Silicon Valley leaders that were in attendance.</p><p>Advice ranged from the cliché to the profound, but all of the interns I spoke with said that they were walking away from the conference with unique advice that they hoped they could follow.</p><p>Here are some of the highlights from the night’s most inspiring speakers.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid to do a little bit of shit work.”</p><p>Curtis talked about his first internship at a startup in high school where in order to get the boss to hire him, he had to split his time between building products and answering phones as the office receptionist. That startup would later go on to be acquired by AltaVista.</p><p>“If you’re not looking for the times that you’re lucky you might miss it.”</p><p>Once the startup he was working at had been acquired, Curtis said he had a choice – was he going to think about how this acquisition had complicated his life plan or was he going to move out West and go for it? Curtis made the trip because he realized how lucky he was.</p><p>“Make sure your company is working as hard for you as you are for it.”</p><p>Callahan talked about how leaving his stale job as VP of Engineering at Yahoo and his “corner cubicle” to become an engineering manager at Facebook surrounded by recent graduates was “one of the best career decisions” he ever made.</p><p>“Shed your ego and open yourself up to learning.”</p><p>Leaving a high profile job at a big company for a smaller, bolder career can be a tough decision to make, but Curtis said that “shedding his ego” and “rebuilding it” at a different company was an essential lesson.</p><p>“College doesn’t prepare you very well for the current tech industry.”</p><p>Callahan focused his presentation on debunking the “shit no one tells you.” Chief of which was his belief that teachers that are imparting “principles of cutting edge high tech thought from 1985” may not be preparing students very well for careers in Silicon Valley.</p><p>“The number one thing for you to get out of college is confidence.”</p><p>Callahan detailed that while the audience would eventually forget the concepts, professors and courses that they took in undergrad, they would gain the self-confidence to tackle major problems.</p><p>People don't like to work with assholes - Michael Callahan, AfterSchool #internapalooza2015 #internapalooza—</p><p>Akshay Mhatre (@akshay1188) June 26, 2015</p><p>“Identify a person that you want to meet, then become friends with their friends.”</p><p>Networking isn’t always easy, but if you’re willing to be assertive and strategic in identifying the contacts you want to make, persistence can pay off Callahan said.</p><p>“The first thing you have to do is move to California.”</p><p>Callahan said that making the move from Chicago to Silicon Valley was one of the most critical moves he ever made, and that for young people thinking about heading to the West coast, it was really something that they just had to go for.</p><p>“There’s a huge demand out here for mobile developers, especially mobile developers.”</p><p>In one of the more specified pieces of advice, Callahan urged attendees looking for something new to discover to go “learn iOS,” because companies “are killing each other to try and get mobile developers.”</p><p>“Risk is proportional with reward.”</p><p>While getting a job at a huge company with high security can be great Callahan said, “You probably aren’t going to become a billionaire.” Meanwhile, “Startups are high risk, but they are also high potential.”</p><p>“When you come to the Bay Area, you understand how small the world is.”</p><p>To Garg, the idea of being connected to people through six degrees is no longer accurate as social media and connective technologies have taken off. Garg theorized that, especially in the valley, people were most likely connected by three degrees or less.</p><p>“Regardless of whether you like the work or not, you should get the offer.”</p><p>Garg told the crowd of interns that “giving 100 percent” wasn’t just a cliché and that they should be putting their full effort into getting job offers from their internships even if they had already decided it wasn’t what they wanted to do.</p><p>“Don’t be the guy or girl who’s always blaming someone else.”</p><p>Taking ownership of your successes, failures and obstacles can make the difference in being successful Guha said. He went on and told the crowd that it’s especially critical for younger interns not to turn their age into an excuse.</p><p>“Always look for roles where you are surrounded by the kinds of people that will guide you.”</p><p>Mentorship was a pretty frequent trend in the advice given throughout the night. Guha specified that not only was it important to find key individuals to rally behind but to also “become part of important tribes.”</p><p>“If you want to succeed and be an entrepreneur, embrace failure. If you’re too weak in the heart, don’t be an entrepreneur, work for someone.”</p><p>Larian founded one of the world’s largest toy companies after moving to the United States with just a few dollars to his name.

    "content": "<p>WhatsApp will finally take a step to becoming a platform after the Facebook-owned company revealed it will begin to integrate businesses services into its app before the end of this year.</p><p>The company first announced plans to connect its userbase — which stands at more than one billion — with businesses back in January, and it today it updated its terms of service in preparation for testing with selected users “in the months ahead.”</p><p>What kind of dialogue will WhatsApp facilitate between users and businesses?</p><p>The aim is to keep things useful, such as flight notifications, receipts or delivery tracking, although marketing messages are mentioned in the newest version of the company’s T&Cs:</p><p>We will explore ways for you and businesses to communicate with each other using WhatsApp, such as through order, transaction, and appointment information, delivery and shipping notifications, product and service updates, and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you may receive containing marketing could include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications, and we will honor the choices you make.</p><p>The move is a very notable one given that WhatsApp has always taken a very aggressive ‘no spam’ approach to its business. “Marketing” messages and “an offer for something that might interest you” could fall into the category of spam if not done right, context is key here.</p><p>Back in 2012, CEO and co-founder Jan Koum threw shade on a number of rival messaging companies which he claimed were “selling” ads to their users:</p><p>No one wakes up excited to see more advertising, no one goes to sleep thinking about the ads they’ll see tomorrow. We know people go to sleep excited about who they chatted with that day (and disappointed about who they didn’t). We want WhatsApp to be the product that keeps you awake… and that you reach for in the morning. No one jumps up from a nap and runs to see an advertisement.</p><p>Advertising isn’t just the disruption of aesthetics, the insults to your intelligence and the interruption of your train of thought. At every company that sells ads, a significant portion of their engineering team spends their day tuning data mining, writing better code to collect all your personal data, upgrading the servers that hold all the data and making sure it’s all being logged and collated and sliced and packaged and shipped out… And at the end of the day the result of it all is a slightly different advertising banner in your browser or on your mobile screen.</p><p>The irony here is that many of those in Koum’s firing line — WeChat, Line, and Kakao — weren’t pushing ads. They opted to make money by connecting businesses with users via “official accounts” that companies could pay to rent and promote. As we wrote before, the ability to reach users directly is a potentially a very powerful new tool — and it remains opt-in for uses. Actual banner ads are few and far between in the messaging space because they ruin the user experience and look alien inside chat, which is a highly personal and curated space.</p><p>It isn’t exactly clear whether WhatsApp’s ‘business communication’ push will be like official accounts, the company didn’t go into detail on the format. What it did say, however, is that it will begin sharing data, and in particular, users’ phone numbers, with Facebook — the company that acquired WhatsApp for a fee that ultimately rose to $22 million — which is a key way it hopes to make messages relevant and not spammy.</p><p>That’s quite a big admission, although WhatsApp users will be able to opt out of sharing their information with Facebook.</p><p>For those who go with the default, this is how your data will be put to work:</p><p>As part of the Facebook family of companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, this family of companies. We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings. This includes helping improve infrastructure and delivery systems, understanding how our Services or theirs are used, securing systems, and fighting spam, abuse, or infringement activities. Facebook and the other companies in the Facebook family also may use information from us to improve your experiences within their services such as making product suggestions (for example, of friends or connections, or of interesting content) and showing relevant offers and ads. However, your WhatsApp messages will not be shared onto Facebook for others to see. In fact, Facebook will not use your WhatsApp messages for any purpose other than to assist us in operating and providing our Services.</p><p>These are major concessions for WhatsApp, but they are fairly inevitable. Facebook spent a lot of money acquiring the company, and while I believe that it wants to build rival chat app Messenger into the more feature-rich ‘WeChat-style’ chat/mobile portal service, it has a duty to monetize WhatsApp. Indeed, Mark Zuckerberg himself once said that monetization begins when a service reaches one billion users, so here we are.</p><p>There is a tendency to view this plan as negative, particularly given that other WhatsApp updates have added useful features to the service — such as encrypted communication and voice calls. On the positive side, the WhatsApp service will retain its focus on simplicity and usability, so don’t expect there to be many distractions from the existing messaging interface you see now.</p><p>But, of course, we don’t know for sure just yet.</p><p>WhatsApp has been fairly vague with its plans for now, so we’ll have to wait until it begins field testing business communications to learn more. Other apps have pioneered the </p>",

They will be available in two sizes. The small one will cost $199 while the big one will cost $299. It is dedicated to Steve Jobs.</p><p>The cover of the book is completely white with an embossed Apple logo on the front cover. You can read “Designed by Apple in California” on the spine — the title is embossed as well.</p><p>Based on the photos on Apple’s website, the book doesn’t contain any text. It’s a collection of 450 photos shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman. There’s no background and products seem to float in the air. It starts with the first iMac in 1998 and ends with the Apple Pencil in 2015.</p><p>This could be a nice present for the holidays, and it’ll definitely shine in Apple stores. But Apple is a technology company. It seems a bit weird that the company would release a photo book.</p><p>First, Apple likes to say that it rarely looks back and only moves forward. A book dedicated to products that you can’t even buy in Apple stores is odd.</p><p>Second, releasing a book that shows that you’re awesome isn’t the coolest move ever. Sure, Apple likes to brag and say that “this is the biggest update in iPhone history” during press conferences.

The book starts with the iMac, which happens to be Jony Ive’s first design assignment at Apple.</p><p>This book seems like Ive’s pet project, showcasing his own work at Apple.

    "content": "<p>Facebook Messenger may have already hit the billion-user club this past summer, but the company is always looking for new ways to increase app usage. The latest attempt is the introduction of â€œconversation topicsâ€ on Messenger â€“ a feature offering suggestions about what to talk about with friends. These conversation starters appear to rely on Messengerâ€™s connection to Facebookâ€™s larger social network, as they reference things your friends have done lately â€“ like where theyâ€™ve been, or events they plan to attend, for example.</p><p>The feature was spotted this weekend on the iOS app by Chris Messina, who posted to Twitter about the new conversation starters.</p><p>We understand that this is currently only a small test Facebook is conducting, which is why not that many people are currently seeing this new section in their own Messenger application at this time.</p><p>The suggested topics have their own dedicated section on the homescreen.</p><p>The conversation topic suggestionÂ appears underneath a friendâ€™sÂ name in the newÂ section. To the right is Messengerâ€™s activity indicator, which shows you when the person was last online.</p><p>In the example above, Messenger displays places the friend in question had recentlyÂ visited, like the Grand Canyon.</p><p>In other cases, the suggestedÂ topics might include things like the songs the friend just listened to on a music streaming service, or an event theyâ€™ve indicated theyâ€™ve said theyâ€™re interested viaÂ Facebook Events.</p><p>The idea behindÂ Conversation TopicsÂ is simple: if youâ€™re looking for a way to break the ice with a new Facebook friend or catch up with an old one, these conversation promptsÂ can help you figure out what to talk about.</p><p>In addition, the feature would have the added benefit of being a more basic News Feed of sorts, as it lets you catch up on friendsâ€™ recent activity, without having to scroll through News Feed and its clutter of shared links, posts from Facebook Pages, ads, and other content.</p><p>Itâ€™s also worth noting that this Conversation Topics feature isnâ€™t the only thingÂ Facebook is working onÂ in order to better connect Messenger users with thoseÂ who share similar interests. In September, Messina had also spotted code buried in the Messenger app which pointed to a feature called â€œRooms.â€</p><p>This appears to be an attempt to build public chat rooms on Messengerâ€™s platform around shared topics and interests, and likely has ties to Facebookâ€™s earlier â€œRoomsâ€ project, now shuttered, which was an experiment in anonymized social networking on Facebookâ€™s part.</p><p>Itâ€™s unclear for the time being if the Conversation Topics are in any way tied to Messengerâ€™s plans to debut public chat rooms, however.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A new report from mobile analytics firm Flurry out this morning shows how Americans’ overwhelming election fatigue and disinterest in continuing to follow political news stories played out during the U. S. Elections. The firm found that two of the lowest dips in news reading activity on mobile devices – where many people today consume election news and information – occurred immediately following the 2nd and 3rd Presidential debates.</p><p>While the use of news reading applications was generally up following each debate, as expected, the percentage increase dropped with each debate, Flurry found. After the first debate, news apps saw a 12% increase in usage, but that dropped to 10% after debate #2. The third debate barely caused a blip, with only a 3% increase in launching news apps.</p><p>Meanwhile, the number of news app sessions declined after the first debate, outside of major news events, like the following debates, the Access Hollywood tape leak and the FBI reopening of the Clinton email investigation, for example.</p><p>The tape leak, in fact, was responsible for the largest uptick in mobile session growth (18%) during the entire election. And the only non-political spike in news activity that was seen during this time was the Chicago Cubs’ win on October 2nd, which caused news apps’ usage to increase by 10%.</p><p>According to Flurry, these trends point to what was likely U. S. users’ overwhelming election fatigue  – something that many were complaining about on social media, as well. This fatigue could have also caused people to disengage from the news cycle, in terms of listening, reading, following up, and fact checking for themselves the topics that were discussed during the debates, compared with previous election years.</p><p>Instead, says the firm, people were “walking away from their phones and news apps, once fatigue set in.”</p><p>In addition, Flurry found that U. S. users’ attention span for following election news stories was only around 48 hours per topic. In other words, users would engage with the first story of a news cyble, but quickly grew disinterested in later developments. This  indicates a level of fatigue, as well, as people failed to read follow-ups and later reports, the firm said.</p>",

    "content": "<p>If you can’t get enough presidential election news – that is, you’re some kind of glutton for punishment – there’s now a new way to get automated updates with the latest poll numbers, along with other election news via Facebook Messenger. The New York Times has launched a new elections news service via its NYT Politics Bot for Messenger that will text you every morning with the new numbers, as well as offer on-demand access to the latest news, key takeaways, and more.</p><p>The service aims to be a simpler way to get the latest about the U. S. Presidential election, without having to spend time browsing the web and reading articles, but it’s limited, of course, to NYT’s coverage.</p><p>To use the service, you’ll first have to add the NYT Politics Bot to Messenger. Afterwards, around 9 AM EST every day, the bot will send NYT’s Upshot election forecast to the mobile messaging client, if you opt in to receiving these alerts.</p><p>You can change these subscription preferences at any time by typing “unsubscribe,” the company says.</p><p>In addition to the daily updates, the bot also offers “Quick Reply” buttons that let you ask for specific information, like “forecast,” “polls,” or even “state forecasts,” if you want to see information related to your own state. Here, the bot lets you pick from suggested key states – like Florida or Ohio, for example – or you can type in another state directly.</p><p>While many news bots rely solely on users clicking on prompts or texting pre-configured commands, what’s interesting about NYT’s Politics bot, which was built by Chatfuel, is that it’s powered by an A. I. engine that also lets you talk to the service more conversationally. That is, you can say things like “Will Hillary Clinton win?” or “I live in Texas,” and it will return the Upshot forecast or the state’s forecast, respectively.</p><p>In addition, NYT reporter Nicholas Confessore will contribute his own musings to the news service, including thoughts on some of the pivotal moments and other takeaways, from now until Election Day. Users will be able to respond to these messages as well, but using only pre-written responses.</p><p>This commentary will arrive later in the day, following the data sent in the AM, says The NYT.</p><p>This is the only NYT bot built specifically for news and storytelling purposes, the company notes, but it’s not the first time the news organization has experimented with bot-based news delivery. The company previously used SMS storytelling to deliver news about the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, and it used to run an NYT Election bot on Slack, which is no longer live.</p><p>The biggest difference between this new effort and the older Slack bot is that it’s now combining both automated and human elements in delivery of the news. This is meant to address one of the issues with today’s chatbots – that the bots’ automation combined with their clunkiness can often make you very aware that you’re chatting with a machine. And not knowing the right commands to use can sometimes lead to frustrating experiences, as well.</p><p>That said, Facebook earlier claimed that news chatbots are some of the most popular ones live on Messenger today, and NYT’s internal numbers seem to support this, too. Though the company won’t say how many subscribers the new bot has, it has achieved their signup goal within only two days of being live. However, The NYT stresses that for now, the larger agenda with this news experiment is not necessarily achieving a sizable user base, but tracking the interaction and engagement levels from those who do decide to participate.</p><p>If all goes well, the bot may be put to further use even when the elections – mercifully – come to an end.

Accordingly, Apple created a page offering up a development kit guidelines for creating software that makes the most out of the skinny new retina touchscreen display.</p><p>It also showed off a few third-party apps from big name companies, like Microsoft and Adobe, who will be offering up functionality for flagship software Office and Photoshop, respectively.

    "content": "<p>2016 has been quite a ride for the players in AI, NLP and ML technologies. From the famous advent of Microsoft Tay at the end of Q1 to the numerous acquisitions of AI and chatbot companies during the latter half of this year, artificial intelligence has been in the headlines every other day.</p><p>In August there was an article on TechCrunch asking a very (seemingly) simple question: Can chatbots help build your next website? Being a web programmer who is working on AI and conversational interfaces, this stirred my interest even more and compelled me to check out the services listed therein — and a few others of the same category.</p><p>My excitement wore off when I found out these AI chatbots were not only at their teething stage, but also made simple tasks much more complex than the DIY builders they are supposed to kill. I researched deeper by checking out similar products of diverse industries, talking to celebrity bots on Facebook Messenger, discussing weather with Poncho, doing late night conversations with insomnobot-3000 and talking to Google Assistant on Allo about what the world is like around me.</p><p>To start, I requested the private beta of Opla, which sent me an invite the same day. It was a very basic experience (especially when you can see through the coding logic) and it failed to convince me that there was a use of AI or machine learning involved in the process. Opla must be working on upgrading their product, so let’s wait for what they come up with.</p><p>As Webware’s free trial just let me create a template website powered by an admin panel, my dream of talking to Harley (their chatbot) remained unfulfilled. So, B12 was the next one in line, which asked me to set up a meeting time before they could enter me into their private beta (ain’t nobody got time for that).</p><p>I searched for more services and found two others doing almost the same thing. One is a California-based startup called Mopro, which claims the “death of DIY,” and the other one is based in L. A. and is named RightClick. The former takes information from the user in the form of a questionnaire and gives a message that their “digital specialist” will contact you. I am still wondering where did I experience AI in the entire process and how was it different from any other agency that I call for a quote.</p><p>The latter, RightClick.io, started off well with their open-ended chat approach where the user can type in anything and responses were decent. But as you move forward, their bot also takes support from UI elements instead of a pure conversational format. The editing interface (as the name suggests) was completely based on right-clicking on the elements, which is quite intuitive to use. They also just use the phrase “AI” for their basic attempt toward a product that might be of some intelligence in the future. But it isn’t right now.</p><p>AI is the new cool trendy phrase of our times. Anything that can respond to your message on its own (even if it is a pre-saved reply) gets labelled as artificial intelligence, which is a disgrace and demotivation to the minds actually working on NLP and machine learning.</p><p>The wave of conversational interfaces is one of those rising tides that every Tom, Dick and Harry wants to surf without even assessing the needs of their target market. For example, imagine a bot for an e-commerce website that responds on a conditioned pattern and fails to understand the actual user requirements, which (on an e-commerce site) can break into a hell lot of branches. This would not only piss off the user, but also hurt the brand image of the site — contrary to the belief of their marketing team, which tried to keep up with the pace that the industry is going with.</p><p>A ray of hope was seeing a recent post about a new bot-authoring platform that not only uses rules, but AI as well, to learn conversational patterns and intonation of the target users. This could be a big step toward empowering the entrepreneurs who are eager to adopt a baby chatbot and raise it like their own.</p><p>On the other hand, we have just said Hello to Google Allo and witnessed a big ripple in the AI ocean with the Google Assistant available within user-to-user chats. Moving forward, a disruptive move by Google would be to announce Allo for Developers, which is most likely to happen sooner or later.</p><p>To make the market more mature, tech giants are not only focusing on improving their products and acquiring companies to lead in the industry, they are making genuine efforts to educate the public and budding entrepreneurs about how they can contribute to and utilize the growth of the AI industry. One big attempt toward this was the announcement of a historic Partnership on AI between Facebook, Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and DeepMind. This Partnership on AI initiative describes its reason for creation as follows:</p><p>“Established to study and formulate best practices on AI technologies, to advance the public’s understanding of AI, and to serve as an open platform for discussion and engagement about AI and its influences on people and society.”</p><p>In conclusion, it is best for business owners to stay on their toes to follow the rapid development in the AI space and decide to make a move when confident about the need of a chatbot in their business model. A smart move would be to integrate the conversational interface in the existing user experience first, rather than forcing the user to put extra effort and time to experiment with a bot that says “Sorry, didn’t get that” in response to every other message.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Yahoo announced this week that it’s adding support for Apple Watch analytics to its free mobile analytics service Flurry, which the company acquired last year. For those developers who are building apps for the Apple Watch ecosystem, it’s important to understand how users are engaging with these new small-screen applications, as user behavior and the metrics that matter are likely to be very different from those for smartphone applications.</p><p>Apple Watch apps, after all, are largely designed to provide quick information at a glance, rather than encouraging lengthy browsing sessions. That means developers may be looking to better understand how many users they have on the Watch, how many notifications they should send (and how many are too many), as well as how their users split their time between the watch and the phone, among other things.</p><p>With the newly introduced Apple Watch metrics, developers can now track new users, active users, the total event occurrences by day, the daily average event occurrences, daily average unique event users, and the percentage of app users engaging with the watch extension.</p><p>To use the new service, developers have to first create a Watch Extension key in their iPhone app, get the latest Flurry SDK, add the Watch extension key to their app and then submit it to the App Store.</p><p>News that Flurry was planning to release Apple Watch analytics was previously announced at a Yahoo developer meetup earlier this month. There, Yahoo Software Developer Hepeng Zhang spoke about how to improve the user experience in Apple Watch apps, saying that the best apps for the small screen would trim the bulk of the app wherever possible. He also talked about various technical challenges in building for the Watch, including memory restrictions. For example, he repeatedly noted that if an app exceeds the memory limit, even for a short time, it would crash.</p><p>At that event, Flurry Analytics Product Manager Brad Jones also talked about how important analytics were to understanding Apple Watch apps’ usage. The platform is so new that no one really knows how people will use these apps yet, he said. It’s even possible that some people will use just the Watch app and not its iPhone companion.</p><p>Flurry is now one of a few companies offering developers the ability to begin tracking Apple Watch app events and usage. Its support follows mobile marketing firm Fiksu’s announcement this week that it would allow developers to track Apple Watch events, as well as Kochava’s earlier move into this space. App Annie also recently updated its Store Stats to track Apple Watch. But as one of the larger players in terms of mobile analytics, Yahoo Flurry’s support will likely reach a wide range of app developers.</p><p>There are over 200,000 developers on Flurry today, and the Apple Watch app store had already grown to 3,500+ apps at launch – more than either the iPhone or iPad had at their debuts.</p>",

    "content": "<p>It’s been increasingly evident for years: smartphone users are digging bigger phones as they do more on screens, and spend less time talking on the phone. And there’s no sign of the appetite for super-sizing mobile handsets abating — not according to a new report from Yahoo-owned mobile analytics firm Flurry.</p><p>The firm has looked at a top slice of data taken from the 1.6 billion devices it tracks every month — focusing on the top 875 devices it says accounted for 87 percent of sessions in March 2015 — to explore global active device usage by screen size. Flurry found that phablets have more than tripled their share of usage since last year.</p><p>In January 2014, Flurry recorded just 6 percent of active users were on phablets versus 68 percent using ‘medium phones’ (devices with a screen size between 3.5 inches and 4.9 inches). But by March this year phablet usage had swelled to a fifth (20 percent), with medium phones squeezed down to 59 percent.</p><p>Full-sized tablets are also being cannibalized — or capped — by phablets, with a shrinking overall share of active users:</p><p>Apple’s first phablet, the iPhone 6 Plus, went on sale last fall — finally affording iOS users who want to remain on Apple’s platform the option of using an i-Phablet. That pent up demand has evidently contributed to driving phablet usage.</p><p>That said, Android remains the dominant force in phablets — which is not surprising, given how many more large-screened Android smartphones there are to choose from versus just the one iPhone. Flurry found that around one-third (36 percent) of Android users are using phablets versus just 4 percent of iOS users. So iOS developers are still mostly going to be focused on building smaller phone experiences — and on iPad apps (full-sized tablet usage accounts for a fifth of iOS usage).</p><p>By contrast, Android usage on full size tablets is very weak (just 3 percent) — underlining what we knew already: that Android tablets have flopped, but also that there has been less impetus and demand for full-sized Android slates because Android phones have had larger screens for longer.</p><p>Flurry has also charted the growth in Android device makers offering phablets — noting that Android phablets only made up 10 percent of overall Android phones back in 2013. But, two years on, phablets account for close to a third (27 percent) of all Android devices. So really the Android phablet is the Android tablet.</p>",

You can still create that personalized news feed, but the service no longer requires a Twitter login.</p><p>Instead, you can go to the Discover section of the app to browse recommended feeds, some created by Nuzzel users, others created by Nuzzel itself.

    "content": "<p>Among the many new applications designed for Apple Watch, there are still a few big names who had yet to reveal how their apps will look and operate. One of those names is Flipboard, the social magazine app which is currently available on iOS, Android, Windows, and more recently, the web. The company offered a preview of their forthcoming Apple Watch app, which they’ll cover in more detail later this week via a company blog post.</p><p>Given that a number of readers today often turn to Flipboard to consume long-form content – like magazine-length articles – in addition to browsing through photos, social updates and shorter news stories, there was some question about how the service would make the transition to the Apple Watch’s small screen.</p><p>Here, it seems, news apps are focused on delivering short bursts of content to readers – and that’s the direction Flipboard is now headed.</p><p>The company explains that users will be able to read a “smart summary” of the news story on the Apple Watch, and then if they want to actually dive in and read the full story, they can do so on their iPhone. The app will take advantage of Apple’s “Handoff” feature in order to pass the link from the wearable device to the smartphone, taking you directly to the story you want to read.</p><p>As for what stories are appearing on the Flipboard Watch app in the first place, that’s where the service’s curation capabilities come into play. Flipboard will algorithmically choose the top 10 stories based on the top 10 topics a user follows on Flipboard, and then present these on the Watch.</p><p>In addition, the Watch app will allow users to add stories they’re shown to their own magazines, or share them with a friend from the Watch itself.</p><p>What’s interesting about seeing how companies in the news space are addressing the challenges of Apple Watch’s smaller screen, is that it’s still unclear today how consumers will engage with this new accessory. Some early testers have said that, by wearing the Watch, they’ve taken their phone out of their pocket much less frequently. Others speculate that consumers will become highly engaged with the device, even taking the time to read entire news stories on their wrist, as they’ve done with other smartwatch platforms.</p><p>Flipboard, meanwhile, has taken the approach to try to straddle the two worlds of Watch and iPhone by offering small screen summaries with the option to transition to the iPhone for a better reading experience, if you choose to dive into its content further.</p><p>That could prove to be a smarter approach than asking readers to scroll down through longer content on the Apple Watch, but it also puts Flipboard in a position of having to compete alongside apps better known for their “breaking news” content, like CNN, for example. Flipboard on mobile has often been about a sort of lean-back reading experience – it began as a tablet magazine, you’ll recall. But the Watch seems like it would favor news of a more urgent nature, and that hasn’t traditionally been Flipboard’s biggest selling point.</p>",

That means customers who shop via the growing number of chatbots from online merchants will be able to transact on Messenger using PayPal’s payment service. In addition, as part of this deal, PayPal says it will make it easier to link your PayPal account to Facebook and Messenger, and it will roll out support for receiving notifications about PayPal transactions to Messenger users in the U. S.</p><p>PayPal’s integration with Messenger had been previously announced.</p><p>Facebook had been beta testing payments in Messenger with select developers, and said that it would roll out this capability more broadly by the end of the year. In addition, Messenger payments are not being limited to PayPal – customers can transact using their payment info already stored in Facebook and Messenger within the bots, as another option.</p><p>Plus, Facebook has said it’s working with others in the industry, including Stripe, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, not just PayPal and PayPal-owned Braintree.</p><p>Still, gaining a foothold in Messenger is a big step for PayPal, which could benefit from its exposure to Messenger’s sizable user base. PayPal has 192 million users worldwide, the company says. Meanwhile, Messenger reached a billion users earlier this year, and reports claim that about 40% of U. S. mobile users are now on Facebook’s messaging platform.</p><p>That being said, PayPal and Messenger’s forthcoming integrations are U. S.-focused for the time being.

S., PayPal says, however.</p><p>Facebook has been working to better integrate payments into its platform for some time now. For example, in spring 2015 it debuted a way for Messenger users to add their own Visa or MasterCard payment information into its chat app in order to send peer-to-peer payments to friends. The move was meant to rival Snapchat’s payments, as well as those p2p offerings from Square (Square Cash), Google Wallet, as well as PayPal itself, and its Venmo application.</p><p>With this new deal, it would seem Facebook is softening its competitive stance, but the company had earlier claimed it had no interest in building a payments business.</p><p>Facebook and PayPal have partnered on other payment initiatives in the past, of course. Most recently, that was with Uber’s integration into Messenger, allowing users to hail a ride through Facebook’s messaging application. (In that case, PayPal-owned Braintree is powering those transactions.)</p><p>And PayPal is used today by merchants who are buying Facebook ads, selling products directly on their Facebook Pages’ “Shop” sections, and is a supported payment method on Facebook-owned Oculus’ site.</p>",

This approach is working well with Instagram, and WhatsApp will operate in this manner. WhatsApp’s brand will be maintained; its headquarters will remain in Mountain View, CA; Jan Koum will join Facebook’s Board of Directors; and WhatsApp’s core messaging product and Facebook’s existing Messenger app will continue to operate as standalone applications.</p><p>In a post on the WhatsApp blog, Koum elaborates on that:</p><p>Here’s what will change for you, our users: nothing.</p><p>WhatsApp will remain autonomous and operate independently. You can continue to enjoy the service for a nominal fee. You can continue to use WhatsApp no matter where in the world you are, or what smartphone you’re using. And you can still count on absolutely no ads interrupting your communication. There would have been no partnership between our two companies if we had to compromise on the core principles that will always define our company, our vision and our product.</p><p>The note about no advertising is interesting, as that’s obviously Facebook’s primary method of monetization on its main platform — and now Instagram. WhatsApp will also keep its subscription fees, which amount to $1 per user after the first year of use.</p><p>WhatsApp investor Sequoia has also posted some information about the acquisition, specifically its very large valuation. The company notes that it only has 32 engineers — making the ratio 1 engineer to every 14 million users. It processes 50 billion messages a day across seven platforms.</p><p>The image above is a note that Koum keeps on his desk, outlining the focus of the company on building a ‘focused messaging experience’.

S. as a 16-year-old immigrant living on food stamps, he had the extra incentive of wanting to stay in touch with his family in Russia and the Ukraine,” says Goetz. “All of this was top of mind for Jan when, after years of working together with his mentor Brian at Yahoo, he began to build WhatsApp.”</p><p>Goetz also calls out the 450M user number and the fact that it has spent exactly $0 on marketing and doesn’t even employ a PR person or marketer; its growth all coming from users.</p><p>WhatsApp only employs around 50 people total. At 32 engineers, that’s $500 million per engineer.</p><p>Facebook currently boasts 556 million mobile daily active users, and WhatsApp alone already has over half of that at 350 million. One particular reason Facebook could be purchasing WhatsApp is to bolster its International footprint — as exemplified by one very telling chart. TechCrunch had previously heard about some abortive acquisition talks between Facebook and WhatsApp in late 2012.</p><p>Facebook is currently down in after hours trading.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A report in The New York Times on a culture clash taking place in Palo Alto set off a bit of speculation as to the possibility of “a ban on coding,” as the article put it. Well, don’t worry. That’s not going to happen.</p><p>It was Mayor Patrick Burt himself who was quoted in the piece, and whose office was reported as looking into such a ban. I contacted Burt and the city council to see if they could provide a little clarity.</p><p>“Unfortunately, the Times article did not capture accurately the issue,” he wrote in an email.</p><p>So You Want To Fix The Housing Crisis</p><p>White House LGBTQ Tech and Innovation Briefing addresses national issues</p><p>TheHelpingHand.club uses Uber to direct homeless people to shelters</p><p>The downtown area, he explained, has never actually been zoned for “software and hardware research and development,” the category under which many tech companies fall — instead, large parts of the city have been zoned for the purpose, specifically the 10 million square feet of the Stanford Research Park. But tech companies have established themselves downtown as well, and until recently no one really made a big deal about it. A city council representative intimated much the same thing in another email.</p><p>“A couple of larger companies have decided to stay in the downtown area as they grow,” Burt wrote, “taking over nearly all office space that becomes available and driving out the local service and business service companies as well as start ups who cannot compete for that space with the larger and more affluent companies. These smaller companies have been getting driven out of the downtown, creating more of a monoculture than what has been a more diverse and vibrant environment.”</p><p>“What I and some of my colleagues on the city council are considering is to clarify and update our downtown zoning codes,” he continued. “We are interested in for the first time formally allowing ‘Research and Development’ in the downtown up to a certain size, but not allowing large corporate campus functions to take over.”</p><p>So it seems that far from banning coding downtown, the plan is to legalize it.</p><p>Of course, that doesn’t mean the move couldn’t be considered hostile to some of the companies that have helped make Palo Alto the town it is today. Especially when seen in the light of another piece of regulation recently introduced that limits new office construction to 50,000 square feet per year in the same area.</p><p>What some see as unsustainable growth is reflected in, as with other tech-heavy towns, a jump in the price of living. Former Planning and Transportation Commissioner Kate Downing resigned in August, citing a lack of progress in accommodating affordable housing and other measures.</p><p>“I struggle to think what Palo Alto will become and what it will represent when young families have no hope of ever putting down roots here,” she wrote. “And meanwhile the community is engulfed with middle-aged jet-setting executives and investors who are hardly the sort to be personally volunteering for neighborhood block parties, earthquake preparedness responsibilities, or neighborhood watch. If things keep going as they are, yes, Palo Alto’s streets will look just as they did decades ago, but its inhabitants, spirit, and sense of community will be unrecognizable.”</p><p>A familiar refrain for many a resident, and not just of Palo Alto, I’d wager. Just what to do about that horrendously complicated issue is a whole other ball of yarn, of course. But with the city putting the brakes on new office development, things may slow down enough that housing and infrastructure can catch up.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I don’t know who wants to shop via chatbot, but that hasn’t stopped a range of companies from launching their own virtual assistants dedicated to this task. The latest to hit the scene is the new ShopBot bot (say that three times fast), from eBay. Debuting today on Facebook Messenger, this bot is aimed at helping consumers narrow down the best deals from eBay’s over a billion listings, the company says.</p><p>eBay claims that shopping bots can help at times when consumers’ needs aren’t fully met by traditional search engines, and can fill in the gaps where human experts aren’t available.</p><p>That could be true in some distant future, but today’s lineup of shopping assistants have felt cumbersome and clunky – you may be chatting with a slightly smarter machine, but not one that can have a true conversation. And it’s not clear that they’re in any way more efficient than performing searches and browsing shopping websites yourself.</p><p>That being said, eBay’s ShopBot is powered by A. I. to help it better understand the context of a shopper’s needs, and it has machine learning capabilities that will be improved over time. In other words, the more you (and others) use the bot, the better it will get, eBay claims.</p><p>Like most bots, you can kick off your interaction just by saying “hello.” Initially, the bot offers a tutorial of sorts, by texting you some tips about how to interact with it and what it can do.</p><p>You then click “start shopping” to get going, and the bot will text back some curated collections to browse for inspiration – like “Women’s Style” or “Editor’s Picks,” for example. You can also just tell the bot what you’re looking for by typing your message below or speaking.</p><p>After sending your message, the bot will ask you to narrow down your choices. For instance if you ask about a purse from a particular brand, it will have you click an area of focus, like “shoulder bag” or “satchel.”</p><p>After your selection, the bot texts back some of eBay’s listings that match your description, and you can click to view more items like that, or click to view the item directly. The latter will open up eBay in a separate window, so you can read the listing in full.</p><p>In reality, it takes several more steps to get to the item in question compared with just typing into a search box on the eBay website, then scrolling through the results while scanning the product thumbnails. These bots, after all, are limited in how many results they can display – and they don’t know the particulars of your search, like if you’re looking for brand-new items or deals, or other details about the product – like whether the bag you want has silver or gold zippers and hardware, for instance.</p><p>And telling the bot these details is not as simple as simply looking for them yourself after a search.</p><p>However, one area where eBay’s ShopBot bot is more interesting than its rivals is that it can work off a photo. That is, you can text it a picture of what you’re looking for, and it will try to match that with recommendations from its site.</p><p>Unfortunately, in testing, this was a hit-or-miss experience. A picture of red wedges returned a mix of other red shoes, but also brown and black shoes that weren’t even wedges – or even the same style of shoe. Pinterest’s visual search engine, for comparison’s sake, not only returned similar shoes, but it also found the exact same shoe thanks to users’ pins. (see above)</p><p>Over time, bots may get better at their jobs, but people’s first impressions are that they’re not that useful. This could hurt their progress in the long run, as consumers will ignore their advances, having recalled their earlier stilted interactions and unproductive trials. They may not have a second shot.</p><p>The ShopBot bot is currently in beta on Facebook Messenger, via shopbot.ebay.com.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The New York Times is launching a new initiative today aimed at converting those who occasionally buy a printed newspaper into digital customers: it’s offering a digital “day pass” for print customers that will allow them to access the NYTimes.com website and mobile apps for free for the day.</p><p>While it may seem like the kind of person who still picks up a printed newspaper isn’t exactly the same demographic who would be interested in reading online, the NYT hopes that by pushing these users to create an account with the paper – including a username and password combo- and then letting them sample the digital edition, they’ll be more likely to convert to digital subscribers in the future.</p><p>According to The NYT, the newsstand copies of the paper beginning today will include a promotional code that grants a day of free access to the online edition. The customer will use the provided keyword which they’ll send to a mobile short code via text message in order to start their free subscription. Afterwards, The Times responds to the customer with a link that will activate digital access.</p><p>To redeem this temporary access, customers have to login to the NYTimes.com site or, if they don’t already have an account, they’ll need to register using their email address and password. When this process is complete, the customer will be able to take full advantage of digital access, including the ability to access real-time news, video, interactive content, and blogs. Access lasts for the full day, ending at 11:59 PM ET on the same day the code is distributed.</p><p>In tests, the process of using the code was fairly quick and painless. You text the shortcode, click the link returned, then log in or register. The whole affair took less than a minute.</p><p>The company describes the promotional codes it’s offering as a trial, explaining that it hopes to “expose retail customers to the benefit of digital access.” The trial has no definite end date as the company plans to gauge customers’ response to determine its next steps.</p><p>“The goal is to drive incremental loyalty among our newsstand customers and to also give them a similar benefit to that of our home delivery customers, who receive All Digital Access complimentary with their subscription,” a spokesperson for the paper explains. “We also want to give newsstand customers a taste of all of the additional content available on NYTimes.com and our mobile apps, that they can’t get with print,” they add.</p><p>The Times is currently sold in 48,000 retailers nationwide, including Starbucks and Hudson News. Its single copy distribution for retail accounts, hotels, airlines and college campuses is approximately 117,461 copies Monday through Friday, and 173,955 copies on Sunday​.</p><p>Like all newspapers, The NYT is focused on making the digital transition in order to continue to grow and manage its business. While a number of publishers offer news content for free, while generating revenue through other means, like ad sales, The NYT bet on using a paywall that keeps its content for its paying customers in addition to ads. Despite putting this barrier in place, the company recently hit the milestone of 1 million digital-only subscribers, and its digital-only revenue will near $200 million this year.</p><p>Growing digital subscribers is critical to the paper’s bottom line. As NiemanLab also reported in August, only a small percentage of Times readers generate a huge part of its income. The site sees around 60 million uniques (U. S.) monthly, but only 1 million of those pay via digital-only subscriptions. (The Times also has 1.1 million print plus digital subscribers.)</p><p>The paper has a number of digital subscription tiers, including all access (website, phone and tablet apps) for $35/month; website plus tablet apps for $20/month; and website plus smartphone apps for $15/month.</p><p>However, other attempts at getting digital customers to pay for NYT content have not fared as well. The NYT Now app, aimed at a younger demographic with an under $10-per-month subscription plan gained 20,000 new subscribers before turning into a free product monetized through sponsorships, not paywalls. The company admitted that while the app had struck a chord with younger users, it hadn’t seen the number of subscription The NYT had aimed for.</p><p>It remains to be see whether or not teasing NYT print customers with a free day of digital access will actually boost the paper’s subscription revenues, as is hoped.</p><p>The move comes at a time when a number of newspapers are experimenting with new business models for the digital age. For instance, Jeff Bezos’ investment The Washington Post, is being offered to Amazon Prime members for free for 6 months as a promotion.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The New York Times said today it’s ditching the paid subscription model for its mobile app NYT Now, after failing to convert a significant number of mobile users to subscribers.</p><p>The app, which previously cost $7.99 per month, was introduced last year as part of a larger effort at the Times to grow its subscription base by introducing new mobile products. The NYT Now app in particular was aimed at attracting a younger, more digital crowd, by offering news summaries that let you quickly catch up on the top NYT stories while on the go, as well as read stories from around the web.</p><p>However, on mobile, NYT Now competes with a number of other quality news apps, including paid products from competing news organizations, as well as mobile-first experiences like Flipboard, Circa, or the quickly-growing app SmartNews, which just took in an additional $10 million, and has remained in the top 10 or 15 news apps on the iTunes App Store for months. Plus, the app is asking users to pay for the news in an era where many seem content to receive their news by way of social media sites.</p><p>In other words, there was little incentive for those looking for a more casual, news digest type of mobile application to pay $8 per month for the benefit of reading the NYT.</p><p>The writing was on the wall regarding NYT Now’s inability to find new paying users last fall, when a company memo cited that while it was a terrific app that “struck a chord with younger users,” its effort to define a market at lower-priced subscription price point were “much less successful.”</p><p>That problem was again confirmed today by the company, which explained that the app has “not seen the number of subscriptions we were hoping for,” according to a company spokesperson. “We’ve learned that we need to spend sufficient time building the audience for a new product before full monetization,” they added.</p><p>The New York Times won’t disclose the number of subscribers NYT Now has, but its user base did include a number of already paying customers who received the app as a free benefit on top of their paid subscriptions, including those who bought digital subscriptions, home delivery subscriptions, and Times Premier subscriptions.</p><p>According to the news organization, the decision to move away from the paid model was also inspired by lessons learned from its Cooking app, which launched as a free product and has seen decent growth and adoption. It’s also been an attractive platform for advertisers, a company rep told us, which is why NYT Now will also continue to be monetized through ads.</p><p>Before, the company served both traditional and paid ads on NYT Now, but with the launch of 2.0, it’s possible for advertisers to sponsor the app, too. The relaunch is kicking off with Delta as a sponsor, in fact.</p><p>With the rollout of NYT Now version 2.0 this morning, the company isn’t only dropping the price to free, it’s also introducing a handful of new features.</p><p>Readers will have access to a number of free Times articles, however the exact number is still fluctuating. At launch, there will be approximately 10 NYT articles in the app, and over a 24-hour period, there will be approximately 20-30 articles appear, not including those from third parties.</p><p>In addition, the app’s look-and-feel has been updated with improved “card” designs which are meant to help readers catch up on the day’s stories even faster than before. Plus, users can share screenshots of these cards with friends – a feature that taps into the mobile messaging trend, and could potentially encourage those who receive the shared stories to check out the app for themselves.</p><p>The app’s popular “Morning Briefing” feature has also been updated in the new release. Going forward, users will receive a push notification on their phones when the briefing is available to read.</p><p>Meanwhile, hoping to cater to a more heavily engaged user base that checks in with the app multiple times per day, NYT Now will highlight those new stories that have arrived since the last time you visited.</p><p>The updated app is live now on the iTunes App Store.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Facebook today filled the biggest hole in its chatbot platform. Messenger bots can accept payments natively without sending users to an external website, Facebook’s head of Messenger David Marcus announced today onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016.</p><p>Finally, the credit card info people already have stored in Facebook or Messenger can be used to instantly make purchases in bots that are part of the new closed beta the developers can apply for. Marcus also revealed that 34,000 devs have joined the platform and built 30,000 bots in the April launch, up from over 10,000 devs in May and 11,000 bots in July.</p><p>To support payments in Messenger, Marcus says that the company is working with all the major players in the industry including Stripe, PayPal, Braintree, Visa, MasterCard and American Express — not just Stripe and PayPal which the Facebook developer blog post mentioned.</p><p>During the talk, Marcus discussed Messenger’s rise to 1 billion users thanks to a forced migration from Facebook’s main app, his relationship with Mark Zuckerberg, and the early stumbles with chatbots that have been used by millions of people across 200 countries.</p><p>In an effort to show Facebook’s commitment to its platform for bots, Marcus announced that all types of News Feed ads can point to them and users can share bots they enjoy with their friends. And instead of forcing all bot interactions to happen through text, developers can now build web views into conversations to pull in interfaces from their websites. This way you could scroll a list of flights, consume different types of media, or even play basic games while still in the chat window.</p><p>This is all part of the Messenger platform v1.2 that launched today. “Inside a thread you have identity, transaction capabilities, the ability to draw UI, and draw native buttons and interfaces,” Marcus explained. “We’re bring all these types of experiences together.”</p><p>He noted also that the webview could be prefetched to be very fast, which one of many under the hood performance improvements the app has seen in recent months to improve the startup time on mobile, and other latency issues.</p><p>All these changes will help to make Facebook Messenger bots better live up to the promise of the platform, which Marcus admitted was perhaps a bit undercooked at launch.</p><p>“The problem was it got really overhyped, very, very quickly,” he said. “The basic capabilities we provided at the time weren’t good enough to basically replace traditional app interfaces and experiences,” he said.</p><p>Because developers weren’t really given enough time or resources to build their bots before the platform went live, many early adopters felt that bots weren’t significantly better (and sometimes were a lot worse), than their mobile web or mobile app counterparts.</p><p>Marcus was asked how far ahead of the bot platform launch Facebook gave developers the final details about what functionality would be offered. He responded, “a couple of weeks only”. When asked if that was enough time to build a high-quality bot, he admitted “probably not”.</p><p>“It’s not easy,” said Marcus of rolling out a platform like Messenger’s bots. “It takes time. What we wanted to do at F8 is enable all the over 34,000 devs on the platform, whether they’re building capabilities for third-parties or actual experiences,” he said.</p><p>While some bots – like those focused on delivering news – have done well, others have needed a lot of work to offering a compelling experience.</p><p>But with the addition of webview and payments, something like Hipmunk’s forthcoming travel bot can do things like help travelers find and book airline tickets and hotels, as well as show itineraries right in the Messenger app.</p><p>Along with the addition of the new capabilities, developers will also now be given more guidance from Facebook on how to build successful Messenger experiences, Marcus noted.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Have you tried the Quartz News app, yet? Please do. Imagine a text conversation with a bot that sends you a news topic. You’re then presented with two choices: Either tap a string of relevant (and surprisingly entertaining) emojis, which is like pressing “learn more,” or tap an “anything else?” button to have another topic served:</p><p>If you opt for the emojis, the app sends 1-3 follow-on texts that provide a high-level summary of the story and link to the article. If you’re lucky, you’ll even see a pertinent and entertaining gif in the mix for added value.</p><p>When it comes to news apps in general, I like to scroll through a daily aggregator feed I’ve personalized to my liking; I usually don’t want someone else telling me which news stories to pay attention to — especially not one at a time. So originally, my intrigue with Quartz News left me feeling a little conflicted (#WhoAmI?).</p><p>Plus, while I’m sure they’ll add personalization, at first this app knew nothing about me and my news preferences. I was fed a random, Hail Mary topic on something I only opted to learn more about 20 percent of the time. Yet I willingly continued to let them try.</p><p>This is because there was a comfortable, visceral familiarity with the app that made me want to spend more time with it. It’s similar to talking to a friend with lightning-quick response time. Except in this scenario, you’re “conversing” with a lite, programmed AI with informative yet amusing responses.</p><p>In other words, I was engaged in large part because I knew an immediate response would follow. It satisfies the “instant gratification” check box. And the medium is familiar — it mimics texting, which is how we spend much of our modern lives.</p><p>That’s when it hit me: The magnitude of what I was experiencing was much bigger than simply news-based interactive texts. In fact, it’s likely just the beginning. Here’s why:</p><p>It’s poised to send shock waves through the live-chat industry.</p><p>How much more fun will it be to skip scanning an endless page of outdated FAQs and instead “text” with a witty bot?</p><p>Live chat has been a significant upgrade in customer support over the years. But this kind of mobile and interactive chat has even more potential. For those brands and companies who elect to use it with customers, I imagine an added layer of interactivity and decision-tree-like qualifiers. As a result, it will maximize moderator efficiency, allowing them to know exactly when they need to step in, while still delighting the customer. These interactive qualifiers wouldn’t be “off the cuff,” either — they would be pre-validated by endless customer support data points.</p><p>The timing is ripe, too. Millennials, for instance, don’t want more customer service, they want different customer service. My hunch is that live-chat adoption will not only increase, but we’ll also see an increased willingness to leave more candid feedback.</p><p>Interactivity amplifies live-chat-provider features while strengthening the brand-to-consumer relationship, whether you have one customer or one million. The learning curve will be virtually non-existent, there will be little to no rollout fear and it’ll come with unlimited upside and brand-messaging customization.</p><p>Anyone on the over/under that Intercom is the first-mover, here?</p><p>Hal 2.0 is coming. AI needs to quickly evolve to have “Siri-like” text conversations with customers. That AI would arguably be able to have a sophisticated conversation with the customer, scan their shopper profile through necessary auths, ask them the correct, pertinent questions and guide them to specific products via informed logic in real time — all without the need of a support rep.</p><p>Quartz's Fun News App Is Quite Unlike Any News App You've Seen Before</p><p>The data repository of consumer insights alone will be invaluable, but we’re also talking about a massively better experience on the customer side. After all, how much more fun will it be to skip scanning an endless page of outdated FAQs and instead “text” with a witty bot?</p><p>Admittedly, I see Amazon being able to have the most fun with a project like this, as they’d be able to predictably scan and package up their personalization techniques via interactive text. They’re already making huge AI strides, as it is. “Hal-azon” comes to mind. Too soon?</p><p>It’s inevitable that players will emerge to take advantage of the opportunities here, which are endless. For example: replace news with promo incentives. I present to you the Quartz app, remastered:</p><p>The potential applied-use scenarios really are endless. From gamification to loyalty to surveys, there will be no lack of opportunity for startups to serve an evolving need.</p><p>I consider this the early stages of next-gen consumer interaction. Dive in, ladies and gentlemen, there’s plenty of room.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The number of mobile addicts is increasing, according to a new report released this morning from Yahoo-owned mobile analytics firm Flurry, which found that 40 percent of the 58 percent total growth in mobile app sessions came from existing users in 2015. That’s a significant increase from the prior years, the company noted, as existing users only accounted for 20 percent of growth in sessions in 2014, and just 10 percent in 2013. While all categories of apps grew, “personalization” apps lead the others, largely thanks to the popularity of emoji keyboards, the report found.</p><p>The fact that most of 2015’s growth in app usage, along with a slowing growth rate overall, points to a market that’s maturing.</p><p>Though 58 percent growth is still remarkable, the growth rate has been steadily dropping over the past couple of years. In 2014, mobile app usage grew by 76 percent, and in 2013, it grew by 103 percent. In other words, instead of relying on new users to fuel growth in app usage, it’s more important than ever for app developers to re-engage their existing users – getting them to come back and then spend more time in the app.</p><p>The year-end report also tracked which types of apps saw the most growth, in terms of app usage. Outside of games, which declined 2 percent, Flurry says that every app category posted year-over-year growth in 2015, but it was Personalization apps, News & Magazine apps, and Productivity apps that saw the largest jumps in usage.</p><p>Personalization apps, which include things like Android lockscreens and emoji keyboards, saw a 344 percent increase in sessions – and this was mainly due to emoji apps, the firm said. This trend is also directly tied the rise of messaging apps, like Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, LINE, and Snapchat, where users want to be able to customize their texts to friends.</p><p>Meanwhile, News & Magazine apps grew their sessions 141 percent in 2015, as more user shifted their media consumption away from TV and desktop computers to smartphones and “phablets” – the latter form factor which Flurry previously pointed to as having dominated holiday sales.</p><p>App usage for Productivity apps also grew a notable 119 percent last year, as people are doing more on their phones, phablets, and tablets, including activities that are still moving off the desktop – like email, or work productivity apps like Microsoft Office, Google Docs, and Slack.</p><p>Lifestyle and Shopping apps were in fourth place with 80 percent session growth, thanks to the fact that more consumers today shop from their phones. Flurry notes that this figure backs up earlier reports from the year which stated that mobile commerce now accounts for 33 percent of e-commerce in the U. S., and 40 percent of e-commerce worldwide.</p><p>This trend is also likely why Apple decided to give Shopping apps their own Category in the App Store just a couple of months ago – not only are consumers doing more mobile shopping, the launch of Apple Pay has made checkout easier, with retailers reporting a more than 2x increase in checkout rates thanks to Apple Pay integrations.</p><p>When Flurry broke down app usage by form factor, it additionally discovered that phablet users were even more engaged with apps than those on smaller smartphones. For example, growth in News & Magazine apps on phablets was 4.8x that of all devices; Sports and Music, Media & Entertainment apps were also higher at 4.6x and 4x, respectively.</p><p>Plus, time spent on phablets grew 334 percent year-over-year (2.9x more than the average), compared to 117 percent for all form factors. With the holiday sales contributing to phablets’ ongoing growth, Flurry believes these devices will be the top form factor by October 2016.</p><p>Given that phablet users spend more time in their apps, and the form factor overall is surging, it’s not surprising to see this has had a direct impact on app session growth throughout the year. And that trend shows no sign of slowing – Flurry says it believes small phones will be extinct by the second quarter of 2016.</p>",

S. first.</p><p>In addition, MasterCard also detailed its MasterCard bot for merchants, will allow online shoppers make purchases on messaging platforms, like Facebook Messenger. Later this year, merchant partners will be able to access MasterCard’s Bot Commerce API to start testing MasterCard integration in their own chatbots, says the company.</p><p>MasterCard is not alone in embracing bot-based commerce. Though it’s unclear that consumers themselves have warmed to the idea of interacting with virtual assistants for online shopping and account management, that hasn’t seemed to slow companies down from developing for the various messaging platforms. For example, American Express debuted its own Facebook Messenger bot earlier this year, and yesterday, PayPal announced its own plans for further Messenger integrations.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Pullstring — née ToyTalk — today launched its eponymous product out of private beta and into the hands of creators of conversational interfaces everywhere. Out of the box, creators can make bots for Facebook Messenger, Slack, Skype, Kik, Telegram and — using the company’s Web API — pretty much every other platform out there.</p><p>The company’s authoring tools are presented as a desktop software package that will be available for the Mac OS X platform today and for Windows “coming soon.”</p><p>“This weekend, one of the best examples of chatbots we’ve seen so far launched as part of Channel 4’s Humans TV show,” says Oren Jacob, CEO at Pullstring. “It was going gangbusters, and is seeing a huge amount of engagement.”</p><p>Eager to check out the quality of the bot, I dove into the world of Persona Synthetics and am embarrassed to say that the time I was meant to be writing this article, I was instead having an intriguing conversation with a chatbot (try it out, it’s pretty awesome). Don’t get me wrong, the bot wouldn’t pass the Turing test, but trying to do so is a different field of computing, Jacob claims.</p><p>“I’ve often said that the characters are better defined by the things they can’t talk about, rather than what they know about,” Jacob complains. He draws the comparison that when you’re ordering a pizza from a pizza restaurant, you could start talking about hamburgers. A human operator would get exasperated, reminding you they’re a pizza restaurant. It makes sense for a bot to do the same. “What happens when a conversation drifts off topic is important. With Pullstring, we have created bots with a huge range. When you are talking with your bank about financial issues, for example, we have to keep the conversation tight and to the point. At the other extreme is our Hello Barbie product, where kids can talk about almost anything.”</p><p>The newly launched Pullstring, then, is the set of tools to help developers and content creators create compelling bots and conversational interfaces as quickly as possible. Most compellingly, perhaps, is that the interactions are self-learning. By using a combination of simple rules and a machine-learning AI, the bot can have conversations that are genuine and useful. Not only that, but machine learning can help having context-appropriate conversations.</p><p>“We worked with Activision Blizzard to help create a bot for Lt. Reyes, one of the characters in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,” Jacob tells me in an effort to explain the lengths the technology can go to in order to create an authentic vibe. “To get a genuine feel to the conversations, we pointed our AI at a large Call of Duty subreddit. We learned from the language used there to figure out how the gamers communicate together. As a result, the bot speaks in a similar way as the gamers would. We matched the tone and created a very credible experience.”</p><p>I haven’t played multiplayer games in a while, but one can only assume that the phrases “pwned” and various slurs were filtered out of the discourse. It worked great, though: Within the first 24 hours, more than 6 million chats were exchanged over Facebook Messenger, and the fans are eagerly awaiting the game’s launch in November.</p><p>Rules-based conversations are a great way to push a conversational product live; it is the bare bones of the experience. However, as millions of customers start having conversations, it becomes possible to learn from these interactions.</p><p>Pullstring’s platform includes metrics tools to help analyze how the conversational interface is performing. In addition to the obvious parts, such as warning the bot’s creators where in the conversations customers are getting stuck, there are ways of optimizing the conversations toward particular goals or outcomes.</p><p>The platform’s superpower, however, is that it remains context-aware across longer conversations, so a conversation you’re having with a customer is less likely to disappear into the weeds.</p><p>Gaming was an early adopter of Pullstring’s tech, including the company’s own Facebook Messenger and Skype game Humani, and a number of games aimed at younger children under the company’s ToyTalk brand. It would be a mistake to think this is all about entertainment, however.</p><p>“We have the ambition to create human-fidelity conversations,” explains Jacob. “We started in entertainment, but that’s not what this technology is primarily for. Our customers are constructing interactions in health, commerce, and much more.”</p><p>ToyTalk renames to PullString, repositions as authoring tool for bots</p><p>Even Barbie Has A Smart Home And Hoverboard Now</p><p>Pixar Alum-Led ToyTalk Teams Up With Mattel To Let Kids Chat With “Thomas The Tank Engine” And Friends</p><p>Operator harnesses chatbots, humans, and $15M to sell US goods to China</p><p>A totally real conversation between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg about a rocket</p><p>There is a strong parallel, however: In entertainment, character and narrative is the only thing that matters — but the same is becoming increasingly important in interactions with commercial and enterprise bots, too. Speaking to computers simply isn’t a lot of fun — after all, when was the last time pressing 2 for English made you squeal with delight? Making conversations feel more human and more conversational is a much more natural way to converse.</p><p>“Conversations are more than he-said-she-said,” Jacob says. “Much more. When you listen to a real conversation between two humans, there are a huge number of variables. A conversation is initiated with an intent: Someone wants to accomplish something. The content is important, too, of course. Together, they create a conversation.”</p><p>In addition to the actual words being said, the company goes deep into linguistics to simulate true conversations. Most importantly, then, there is the language-level interaction. A real conversation isn’t that person A finishes what they say, and person B listens carefully before giving a considered answer. It’s a game of back-and-forth, of interjectio</p>",

Earlier this year, it’s register-to-vote feature was credited with a spike of 2 million people in voter registration, and the company also recently made it possible for political candidates to add their stances on issues and endorsements to their Facebook pages. But this is the first in-depth political feature from Facebook. While the feature will go live today, most users won’t start seeing it pop up in their newsfeeds until next week.</p><p>Prospective voters can review information about the candidates’ stances on the issues and view their endorsements, select their favorite candidates, and email their ballot choices to themselves for later reference. The endorsements and issues that Facebook rolled out last week will appear in the vote planning feature.</p><p>Many users have likely already made up their minds in the headline-grabbing presidential election, but may be unaware of the candidates running for their local city council, or local ballot initiatives. Users can also check to see who their friends are voting for if they are undecided about particular candidates or issues.</p><p>The vote planning tool will initially show information on presidential and statewide candidates — if users want to see information on local issues, they will need to enter their addresses. Facebook says it will discard all of the voting information after 60 days and won’t publish any polling data gathered from the tool.</p><p>Users can choose whether or not to make their picks private or allow their friends to view their choices on a case-by-case basis — so you can publicly endorse a proposition, but keep your presidential pick private.</p><p>“We want to make it easier for people who want to participate to do so, and to have a voice in the political process,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a blog post announcing the new feature.</p><p>The information on candidates and issues isn’t created by Facebook, which likely wants to avoid allegations of partisanship after its Trending Topics feature was accused of bias against conservative news outlets earlier in the election cycle. Instead, the data comes from the Center for Technology and Civic Life, a nonpartisan organization that has gathered ballot information from across the country. If users think any of the CTCL data is incorrect, they can report the error to Facebook.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Although Microsoft bought to-do list app maker Wunderlist back in 2015, the company has been working on another to list app experience, code-named Project Wunderlist, which is now in private beta testing. Not much is known about Microsoft’s intentions with its new app, but according to a report out today, this simple to do list app will soon be available on iOS, Android and on Windows 10.</p><p>The app’s existence was previously known, but a new report from the blog Thurrott.com has some of the first screenshots of what the app looks like in action.</p><p>According to the post, Project Cheshire has progressed to beta testing and has been updated with a bit more polish than when it was first spotted earlier this year. But it’s still not very impressive, at first glance.</p><p>The images show a fairly bare bones to do list application that lets you create lists, add items, set reminders, and sync your lists across platforms. You can also theme the lists with a basic color picker, and a selection of rather boring banner images. The only interesting feature, really, is that the app can also suggest tasks to add to your list. However, it’s unclear where this information is pulled from.</p><p>The app itself is already live here on the Windows App Store as “Project Cheshire,” where it’s described as a “brand new and simple, yet incredibly focused to-do app that helps you get things done.” The description also notes that the app is in the early stages of development.</p><p>Those who were recently able to download the app to their device said they couldn’t actually use it  – it was displaying only a blank screen and the message “coming soon.” One user also pointed out that only corporate account holders can currently use the app.</p><p>This could imply Microsoft is intending this new app more for business use, while Wunderlist might remain more consumer-facing. It would also make sense if Microsoft was working to develop its own counterpart to Google’s Keep app, or even an upgraded Outlook Tasks experience which broke out your to-do’s into their own standalone app.</p><p>That being said, while the app doesn’t look like Wunderlist, that company’s technology could still be under the hood in Project Cheshire – and the user interface is merely a fresh coat of paint on top of the Wunderlist backend.</p><p>We’ve asked Microsoft for more information about Project Cheshire and its status, and will update if the company offers a comment.

The program, launched on the stage of TechCrunch Disrupt last month, aims to bring together a large community of students interested in learning, and eventually contributing, to the front lines of autonomous car development. As one of Udacity’s nanodegree initiatives, it was designed in conjunction with large corporations with hiring in mind.</p><p>Previously Udacity had built partnerships with Mercedes-Benz, Nvidia, Otto, and Didi Chuxing. Today however, it is adding BMW,HCL, AutonomouStuff, Elektrobit, HERE, NextEv, Local Motors, McLaren Applied Technologies, Polysync and LeEco to its rosters.</p><p>The job of selling a firehose of engineers to companies in the automotive ecosystem already struggling to attract and retain top talent is an easy one. The expanding list of partners serves as corporate validation for the unorthodox re-training of engineers outside of the traditional university pipeline.</p><p>The partnerships are further evidence that companies at all levels of the automotive supply chain are doubling down on autonomy as the future of driving. Many of the companies on Udacity’s list have already made their self-driving car initiatives public. McLaren Applied Technologies in particular came into the spotlight when rumors emerged that Apple could have been interested in acquiring the company to build out its own driverless car initiatives.</p><p>For students, the new partners are a bit like a jumpstarted alumni network that they would otherwise receive at a more traditional institution. The idea is that up and coming engineers taking part in the Udacity program will be able to play off the company’s network to secure jobs and internship opportunities.</p><p>The company will be holding an event alongside a handful of these partners next week to answer questions and build community. The event coincides with the start of the first cohort on the same day. Nothing quite like starting a degree program with a panel on how to get out as soon as humanly possible.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Small businesses have their pick of affordable DIY website-building platforms: Squarespace, Wix, Weebly and Strikingly, to name a few. But these “no coding skills required” platforms struggle to acquire and retain customers. While the UI of these platforms is often beautifully designed, it’s still too much work — and for business owners, who has the time?</p><p>A fresh crop of website-builder startups noticed that the “build a website from your browser” pitch is not enough to attract non-technical business owners who have no interest in becoming their own web designers. These startups are leading a “death of DIY” movement that is putting the power of design and development back into the hands of experts. The bet is that the full-service, i.e. “do it for you,” model is a better approach than asking small-business owners to do all the hard work themselves.</p><p>In addition to providing human expertise, these startups are employing new AI and chatbot technologies to optimize the website-building process. The goal is to provide enough time savings and professional design support to lift the burden off the small business owner, making them more satisfied and more likely to stick with the service.</p><p>I’ve used some of these AI/chatbot platforms in beta and have found the chatbot experience to be convenient and fast. Admittedly, it’s fun to chat via a messaging interface about changes to my website. And the chatbot excels at simple tasks like responding to basic questions, such as how many visitors my site had today.</p><p>But, so far, I’m not convinced chatbots and AI solve a real problem for small-business owners. As with all aspects of service, quality and personal attention through human conversations are more important than the convenience of quick answers to simple questions.</p><p>During the website setup experience, responding to a chatbot’s questions is not that much different than filling out a form about your project. For example, what is the name of your site? What color do you want? What is some text you’d like on the home page? Answering these questions in chat format instead of via a web form did not necessarily save me any time or effort — it’s just a slightly different interface.</p><p>And it’s not clear how to edit the decisions that the chatbot makes on my behalf. While it’s appealing to give the chatbot a command like “edit text” and write new text, it’s not clear to which line of text I’m referring.</p><p>For initial setup of a website, the chatbot does a good job of simulating the experience of talking to a professional web designer about the goals of my business website. But getting to a generic first template and adding my title and text are not the hard part of the process. The hard part is customizing, polishing and fine tuning, which could be a stretch with a chatbot.</p><p>Additionally, once the initial template is set up, a chatbot cannot compete with an intuitive WYSIWYG for editing existing content. The point-and-click experience is very intuitive and hard to beat. An ideal solution will most likely combine chatbot support for some uses cases, and a point-and-click editor for other use cases.</p><p>But let’s be honest, many small-business owners have no interest in logging into their website and making changes themselves — they’d rather tell someone the changes they want. In that regard, the chatbot provides a hand-holding experience that is more approachable than the website editor interface. For those who have no interest in touching their own website, a chatbot has the potential to take your commands. Whether those commands are properly interpreted and executed remains to be seen. Perhaps those more difficult requests are escalated to a human support person who can better interpret and execute them.</p><p>Here are a few new startups pioneering the chatbot-driven “death of DIY” movement:</p><p>Opla uses Facebook Messenger to chat with you about your website project. Opla is “your friendly website ninja. Opla your virtual assistant handles your website using natural conversation with you.” Opla is in private beta.</p><p>Webware uses an AI bot named “Harley” to chat with you over email about your website project. “Harley is your AI-powered personal assistant to help you build your website and grow sales. Chat with Harley over email to complete the initial setup of your website. Once your website is up and running, she will continue to be your point of contact as you manage and grow your website. No logging in. No useless dashboard. Just Harley.” Harley is currently available for paying customers.</p><p>B12 is a freshly funded startup. “Machine intelligence and automation enable design teams to work faster, smarter, and better. Cost and time savings are passed to our customers.”</p><p>While a few post-DIY startups like PageCloud, The Grid and Mopro have in the past few years teased AI as the future of website building, it’s too early to tell if automated design approaches are proving effective for real customers. Many of these startups have not yet launched (The Grid); others are still in the experimental phase.</p><p>While automated support via a chatbot may have obvious benefits, many traditional website building platforms are rejecting the notion of chatbots altogether. The secret sauce to relationship and technical support may be human touch, not impersonal AI support. Weebly, for example, promises that their support channels will always be manned by a real person. When I asked them about their chatbot strategy, they responded: “We do not utilize chatbots for support. You always receive a real live person. It has always been this way and always will be.”</p><p>Indeed, chatbots could have the opposite effect of their intended benefits. Support from a robot may be as unappealing as talking to an automated phone support from an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. In many ways, my brief experience with chatbot support was reminiscent of talking to the cable company’s IVR system — it failed to understand the context of my question, and</p>",

Much like goods and coins before it, data is becoming an important currency for the modern world. The data’s value is rooted in its applications to artificial intelligence. Whichever company owns the data, effectively owns AI. Right now that means companies like Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, IBM and Microsoft have a ton of power.</p><p>In an act of self-governance, these five companies came together today to announce the launch of the new Partnership on AI. The group is tasked with conducting research and promoting best practices. Practically, this means that the group of tech companies will come together frequently to discuss advancements in artificial intelligence. The group also opens up a formal structure for communication across company lines. It’s important to remember that on a day-to-day basis, these teams are in constant competition with each other to develop the best products and services powered by machine intelligence.</p><p>Financial support will be coming from the initial tech companies that are members of the group, but in the future, membership and involvement is expected to increase. User activists, nonprofits, ethicists and other stakeholders will be joining the discussion in the coming weeks.</p><p>“We want to involve people impacted by AI as well,” said Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder and head of applied AI at DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet.</p><p>The organizational structure has been designed to allow non-corporate groups to have equal leadership side-by-side with large tech companies.</p><p>As of today’s launch, companies like Apple, Twitter, Intel and Baidu are missing from the group. Though Apple is said to be enthusiastic about the project, their absence is still notable because the company has fallen behind in artificial intelligence when compared to its rivals — many of which are part of this new group.</p><p>The new organization really seems to be about promoting change by example. Rather than preach to the tech world, it wants to use a standard open license to publish research on topics, including ethics, inclusivity and privacy.</p><p>“The power of AI is in the enterprise sector,” said Francesca Rossi, an AI ethics researcher at IBM Research. “For society at-large to get the benefits of AI, we first have to trust it.”</p><p>The focus of the organization is a refreshing juxtaposition to more pop-culture discussions about the risks of artificial intelligence. While the jury is still out as to whether a singularity event could threaten mankind, we already face a long list of challenges in today’s world of AI. While computers are not at a point yet where they can take all of our jobs, they can amplify the negative tendencies that humans already possess. A biased world can result in biased data sets and, in turn, bias artificial intelligence frameworks.</p><p>To combat this, companies like Microsoft have already formed AI ethics advisory boards. But, rather than override existing efforts, the new group augments projects already undertaken at individual companies and provides a forum for sharing valuable advice. The group plans to make discussions and minutes from meetings publicly available.</p>",

This allows Poncho to cover every zip code in the United States.</p><p>Given that Poncho came out of the same umbrella as Giphy, most of Poncho’s weather forecasts included a fun gif with some jazzy copy about today’s weather.</p><p>Users could set the time they wanted to receive a text or email about the weather based on their daily schedules. For example, you could ask for the weather in the morning before you go to work, around lunchtime when you head out for some grub or to walk the dog, and in the evening for when you’re ready to go out and get hammered.</p><p>Over time, however, Poncho realized that it was acting as an alarm clock for users without ever building an app.</p><p>“We found most people were waking up with Poncho anyway,” said Mandel.</p><p>And so was born the Poncho app.</p><p>The forecast for the Poncho app is the same as the email and text forecast, but the app adds special alarm clock functionality via push notifications.</p><p>After the user sets the alarm, Poncho will send a push notification with an abridged version of the forecast right on the homescreen, complete with specially composed music which is personalized based on your weather. In another act of betaworks brotherly love, the Poncho team tapped the same composers that create the music for Dots, another betaworks brand.</p><p>Poncho didn’t disclose user numbers, but given that it’s the one truly differentiated product in the weather space, it’s easy to imagine that the two-year-old company continues to grow its user base.</p><p>Which presents some very interesting opportunities.</p><p>With real market penetration, Poncho could feasibly start offering native advertising for various products based on the weather. We’ve already seen some integrations on the email and text service with companies like Seamless on particularly rainy days, encouraging users to stay in and order lunch.</p><p>As part of the launch, Poncho is partnering with GE to include information around energy conservation and clean energy production based on the weather. For example, on a super windy day, Poncho might include the fact that today’s wind (when put through GE’s wind turbines) could produce enough power to light up the Grammys.</p><p>Poncho has built a specific section of the app for sponsored content, but the Poncho writers are tasked with coming up with the copy.</p><p>The alarm clock itself also offers an opportunity to make money. Users could pay extra to customize their music, or up-and-coming artists could pay to have their new song featured as a wake-up tune.</p><p>But Mandel says the most important thing is continuing to build that friendly relationship with the user, and that will remain central to any future moves toward monetization.</p><p>The Poncho app is available here on iOS and coming soon to Android.</p>",

The publisher claims that the innovations developed in the app have now been incorporated into the Times’ other digital platforms, including its flagship NYTimes app. Specifically, the main app has the same curated feel pioneered by NYT Now, the company says, and a easy-to-scan list of the day’s top stories.</p><p>In reality, NYT Now was a mobile experiment that ran its course. Introduced in 2014, the idea was to offer readers a selection of the day’s “top” news for less than the cost of a full subscription. The paper was also looking to appeal to a younger, more mobile audience who didn’t grow up with newspapers, and instead read their news online.</p><p>Originally, the app offered $8 per month subscriptions, which was around half the price of the lowest-cost digital subscription.</p><p>However, last May, The NYT dropped the subscription model altogether, and turned to brand sponsorships as a replacement. At the time, the publisher admitted that the app had “not seen the number of subscriptions we were hoping for,” according to a company spokesperson. “We’ve learned that we need to spend sufficient time building the audience for a new product before full monetization,” they added.</p><p>The NYT didn’t then disclose the number of subscribers it had, but an internal company memo claimed that the experiment with lower-cost subscriptions was “much less successful.”</p><p>The truth of the matter is that it was difficult for NYT Now to compete with freely available news on the web, as well as with other dedicated news-reading applications, like SmartNews, Apple News, Flipboard and others. And that was especially true when trying to target a younger generation who didn’t grow up in the era of having to pay for their news content.</p><p>According to The NYT, the app had 334,000 total unique users at its peak in May 2015, and it averaged 257,000 unique users over the last three months. According to data from Sensor Tower, the app had approximately 900,000 downloads worldwide on iOS and Android from launch through today.</p><p>Ahead of the app’s final shutdown, planned for September, many of its features have already made their way to the core mobile app, including the morning and evening news briefings, bullet-point lists and more conversational tone, The NYT also claims.</p><p>As of next month, the app will no longer be updated but registered users will be invited to subscribe to The NYT via email. The app will be pulled from the app store the week of Aug. 29.</p>",

After investigating this claim with the assistance of an outside forensic expert, the Company could not substantiate the hacker’s claim. Following this investigation, the Company intensified an ongoing broader review of the Company’s network and data security, including a review of prior access to the Company’s network by a state-sponsored actor that the Company had identified in late 2014,” Yahoo said in the filing.</p><p>Yahoo also reported that 23 consumer class action lawsuits have been filed in response to the breach, but that it’s too early to estimate monetary damages. It estimates the hack has led to a loss of $1 million so far.</p><p>The question of when Yahoo learned of the breach is essential to its planned sale to Verizon. Verizon has reportedly asked for a $1 billion discount in light of the breach, which was not disclosed until after the September sale even though Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer allegedly learned of the breach in July. (Disclosure: Verizon owns TechCrunch.)</p><p>In today’s filing, Yahoo says it has formed an independent committee to review “the scope of knowledge within the Company in 2014 and thereafter regarding this access, the Security Incident, the extent to which certain users’ account information had been accessed.”</p><p>Senator Mark Warner has asked the SEC to investigate what Yahoo knew about the breach and when it knew it, citing an earlier Yahoo filing that claimed the company was not aware of any security breaches. “Yahoo’s September filing asserting lack of knowledge of security incidents involving its IT systems creates serious concerns about truthfulness in representations to the public,” Warner said in a statement.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A startup called Heek wants to make building websites as simple as chatting over text and answering a few questions. Using a conversational interface, the bot asks you questions about yourself, your business and your site, then lets you click to see different designs you can customize to meet your needs. The bot will even prompt you to save your work, as you get further into the site creation process.</p><p>Many of today’s chatbots have fallen short when it comes being a more efficient way of interacting with a web service, and often lead to frustrating experiences due to their restrictive nature.</p><p>But in Heek’s case, the idea of turning website creation into something that can be handled conversationally could appeal to the small business owner who doesn’t have the funds for a professional designer, nor the technical chops to manage website creation – even via the more basic website builders that are on the market today.</p><p>Heek’s service is surprisingly easy to use. With a click to get started from the Heek website, the bot begins by asking for your name, your company’s name, the type of business you have, then presents you with a variety of site templates to choose from, ranging from e-commerce storefronts to sites for public figures, charities, businesses without products to sell, or those in the “media/entertainment” space, like news, food, music, sports, education, animals, and more.</p><p>You can then click through the available templates in your category by clicking the “Next design” and “Previous design” buttons the bot offers.</p><p>Instead of figuring out what sort of things need to be on your website, Heek will suggest items you may want to add. For example, it might recommend that you add your business’s address or a contact form, or a navigation menu for moving between pages. To accept a suggestion, you just click “OK.” To skip it, you’ll click “No thanks” and Heek will move onto the next element to be designed.</p><p>Depending on the site you’re working with, you can also customize the pages further, whether that’s uploading your own photos or adding product information and pricing, among other things.</p><p>However, not all of the site design is done via this text-based chat. Some things, like swapping out photos and editing the text still require you to interact with the web builder directly. (The right side of the screen shows you your site in progress).</p><p>Heek doesn’t exactly explain this to you, but it’s fairly obvious because when you move your cursor overtop images, a pop-up that reads “change image” appears, for instance. You can also click into the text areas and start typing, as well as adjust the text’s font, size, look (bold, italics) and more.</p><p>The templates themselves are not entirely rigid, either. Like most WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) website builders, you can drag and drop various elements around the screen to customize the design.</p><p>But with Heek, you don’t really have to – out of the box, the site offers placeholder text and stock images to make site creation less of a hassle.</p><p>The service costs $30 per month, or $25 per month if you opt to pay annually. This fee includes the site creation, your custom domain name, search engine optimization, and customer support.</p><p>However, what’s great about using Heek is that you don’t have to commit to a plan or even create an account to try the service for yourself. By clicking the button on the website to get started, you jump head-first into site creation. If you’re still unsure after your site is finished, you can keep using the service for 14 days before entering your credit card information to keep the site live.</p><p>Heek was founded late last year by Nicolas Fayon, previously the co-founder of a Facebook Page customization tool called PageYourself.</p><p>“We quickly realized that [small and medium businesses] almost all had the same problem with their online presence: the lack of time, and the lack of knowledge,” explains Fayon as to why he built Heek. “We worked on how to solve that problem and realized that the solution was to give them the same level of service as an agency would, at a very affordable price.”</p><p>Fayon notes also that the chatbot will get smarter over time, as more people use the product.</p><p>The startup is now one of several focused on making website creation even simpler than via more traditional drag-and-drop editors like those from Wix, Weebly, GoDaddy, Squarespace, and others. Instead, it competes with newer tools like PageCloud, which aims to make editing sites as easy as using Powerpoint, for example. The Disrupt NY 2016 hackathon winner AlexaSite also came up with an idea around editing sites just by using your voice – but it was a hackathon project, not a business you can use today.</p><p>Heek’s service was previously only available in private beta, but since the launch of version one last week, it has seen around 2,500 users test it out, Fayon says.</p><p>The startup is a team of 10 based in Paris, and is backed by €700K from French fund OK Invest.</p>",

Unlike Macy’s, which also recently added the device to its in-store Apple boutiques, Kohl’s says it’s not launching Apple Watch as an electronics partner. Rather, it will sell the smartwatch in its activewear and wellness sections, the retailer said.</p><p>The move follows other attempts by Kohl’s to establish its brand as a retailer focused on activewear, particularly for the female consumer. Earlier this year, for example, it added Under Armour apparel, accessories and footwear to all of its 1,160 stores.</p><p>In the Kohl’s stores where the Apple Watch is sold, it will be placed on four-foot tall displays which will show off four different models. Ten different kinds of Apple Watches will be stocked, and Kohl’s employees will staff the Apple Watch section.</p><p>The tie-up is hoped to attract more customers to the department store over the holiday shopping period, including those with more to spend – and who may not have otherwise frequented a Kohl’s. Meanwhile, for Apple, the partnership means it will gain access to a wider demographic for its smartwatch – including the discount shopper that a brand like Kohl’s attracts.</p><p>Outside of Apple stores, several retailers today now carry Apple Watch, including Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Macy’s and Dick’s Sporting Goods, for example.</p><p>Macy’s, which announced plans to sell the watch only weeks ago, will only feature Apple Watch in 180 stores.</p><p>The Kohl’s Black Friday ad, out now, shows how it will use the Apple Watch to entice shoppers. The company is advertising the Apple Watch Series 2 as available for $369, earning $105 Kohl’s Cash, and the $269 Apple Watch Series 1 earns $75 in Kohl’s Cash.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Verizon, the largest carrier in the U. S. and owner of a large set of media properties via AOL (including TechCrunch), today reported mixed third-quarter earnings and saw growth in subscriber numbers. But it was light on a detail about the big elephant in the room: would it ask for a discount on its original, recent $4.83 billion offer to buy Yahoo?</p><p>Update: During the analyst call, Verizon executives were asked about the impact of the Yahoo privacy breach on the deal.</p><p>“Look, [CEO Lowell McAdam and Verizon general counsel Craig Silliman] have both commented on this recently,” said Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo. “Let me just reiterate what they have said — we are still evaluating what it means for the transaction.”</p><p>Shammo added that Verizon’s lawyers had their first discussion with Yahoo about the issue yesterday and noted that it was “an extremely large breach”: “We have to assume it will have a material impact on Yahoo.”</p><p>He also suggested that there will probably be a lengthy evaluation process before Verizon makes a decision.</p><p>Verizon reported $30.9 billion in revenues for the quarter with non-GAAP earnings at $1.01. This slightly missed and beat analysts’ respective midpoint estimates of $31.09 billion in revenues and $0.99 for EPS. Pointedly, the revenue figure was down 6.7 percent compared with a year ago (although slightly up on the previous, consecutive, quarter), and EPS was also down nearly three percent in the same period.</p><p>Wireless revenues, the majority of its sales, were $22.1 billion, also down by 3.9 percent, “as more customers continued to choose unsubsidized device payment plans.”</p><p>Verizo reported 442,000 retail postpaid net additions for its Wireless division in the quarter (ex-IoT and wholesale connections… IoT is another area the company very much wants to push going forward). Verizon said at the end of Q3 it had 113.7 million retail connections, up only 2.6 percent year-over-year.</p><p>But there was nary a mention of the Yahoo situation in the earnings report, except to note that the deal is still ongoing. The situation, of course, is that Verizon reportedly might propose to pay as much as $1 billion less for the internet property after it revealed a security breach that affected 500 million users, and that it was allegedly scanning customers’ emails on an order from the government, without disclosing that information.</p><p>(Yahoo, meanwhile, this week tried to demonstrate that the controversies have had little impact on its business.) If Verizon cancels the deal completely, it must pay a termination fee of about $145 million. We will listen to the call later to see if anything gets brought up and addressed then.</p><p>Verizon’s subscriber numbers appear to be a short-term indication that at least for now it’s not seeing extensive churn with the arrival of the iPhone 7 and competing trade-in offers from other carriers for the newer device.</p><p>Perhaps to offset further worries around this, earlier today Verizon also reminded the public that it’s also taking orders for Google’s Pixel phones, although it has also already warned that in store the XL model, which was due to go on sale today, is already sold out.</p><p>On the wireline front, Verizon reported revenues for Fios, its fiber-based video and internet service, of $2.8 billion, up 4.4 percent on a year ago, and a turnaround for declines in Q2 that it faced during the employee strike. It also added 90,000 internet and 36,000 customers in the quarter.</p><p>Notably, Verizon didn’t mention anything in the earnings report about one of its other recent video efforts, Go90, which is an OTT play that will be one of the areas where Verizon would have integrated Yahoo. There seems to be some anecdotal evidence that it’s not proving to be much of a success so far.</p><p>Revenue growth for the company right now is an important metric, considering its recent track record and how it indicates that growth has gone off a cliff in the last three quarters:</p><p>Last quarter, Verizon reported EPS of $0.94 and 615,000 retail postpaid net additions in its wireless business as well as 0.94 percent retail postpaid churn, on revenues of $30.5 billion, down 5.3 percent on the year before.</p><p>In pre-market trading, Verizon shares were down by nearly three percent.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Yahoo released its semiannual transparency report today, the first issued by the company since Reuters revealed earlier this month that Yahoo scanned its users’ email accounts at the behest of the U. S. government.</p><p>In an effort to inform consumers about how frequently the government snoops on their information, and how often companies are able to narrow or refuse the requests, Yahoo and many other technology companies make public on a regular basis data about requests from law enforcement agencies for user data.</p><p>“We review demands for narrowness, legal sufficiency, duration, and scope, and consider all appropriate options before we comply, including seeking clarification or modification of the demand, or even challenging the demand in court,” Yahoo general counsel Ron Bell wrote in a blog post accompanying the transparency report.</p><p>Bell was reportedly one of the Yahoo executives, along with CEO Marissa Mayer, who approved the installation of software in spring 2015 that scanned Yahoo email accounts for specific data. The software was quickly discovered by members of Yahoo’s security team, who initially believed hackers had broken in and installed the program. The resulting clash between leadership and security engineers reportedly lead to the departure of chief information security officer Alex Stamos.</p><p>As we previously reported, Yaho’s spring 2015 transparency report does not reflect an unusually high number data disclosures to the government, as might be expected from a dragnet email scanning program. At the time, the company only reported 21,000-21,499 user accounts requested under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and 0-499 accounts requested with National Security Letters. However, Yahoo allegedly scanned all of its nearly 300 million users’ email accounts — a vastly larger group than reported.</p><p>Bell clarified how Yahoo reports the number of requests that don’t specifically identify an account in his post:</p><p>We have added information to explain how we report on the numbers for government demands for user information that don’t specifically identify a particular account as such: “[I]f a Government Data Request demanded information about accounts that satisfy specified criteria (e.g., accounts registered under a particular proper name or accounts associated with a particular phone number) and we determined that it was appropriate to produce data in response to the request, we would report the total number of accounts about which information was produced to the government in connection with that Government Data Request.”</p><p>This isn’t a change from how Yahoo has done things in prior reports, but it is a clarification about how Yahoo would handle a request for specific criteria like the one that allegedly led to the scanning. Yahoo’s transparency report only reflects the number of accounts from which information was disclosed, not the number of accounts searched — which may explain the discrepancy between a scan of 300M accounts and a disclosure of data from roughly 21,000 accounts.</p><p>Between January and June 2016, Yahoo says it received 12,666 requests from governments worldwide focused on 20,511 user accounts. It disclosed content or data on 7,779 accounts and rejected or found no data for 4,887 requests.</p><p>In the United States, the number of government requests reported by Yahoo remained steady. Yahoo says it received 4,709 requests from the U. S. government, targeting 9,408 accounts. It disclosed content in response to 24 percent of the requests.</p><p>During its last six-month disclosure period, Yahoo reported 4,460 requests from the U. S. government. The company reported 19,000-19,499 accounts targeted by FISA requests, but during the current disclosure period, the company did not report any data on FISA requests. Yahoo is required to delay releasing information on FISA requests after the passage of the USA Freedom Act.</p><p>As Bell notes in his post, he recently asked Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to address the media reports on Yahoo’s email scanning program. Bell asked Clapper in a letter to tell the public whether or not the government ordered the email scanning program, declassify the order, and give context about why it happened.</p><p>“At Yahoo, we have long advocated and fought for increased transparency by governments. In sending that letter, we continue the fight,” Bell said.</p><p>Tumblr, the blogging platform owned by Yahoo, also released its transparency numbers today. Tumblr received just 274 requests from governments worldwide over a six-month period. “That’s 0.0001% of all blogs on Tumblr, which means any given blog has about one-in-a-million chance of being subject to a request — slightly less likely than your chance of being killed by a meteorite. Hm!” the company said in a post announcing the disclosure.</p><p>This post has been corrected to clarify that Yahoo has not changed its transparency reporting practices, merely clarified them.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Chatbots have been in the news a lot this year. First there was Tay, Microsoft’s racist love child, who just couldn’t keep herself under control. Then came Facebook with its Messenger bots, which, by most accounts, didn’t start well. And now there’s news coming from Viv, which at first glance seems like Siri 2.0. Not surprisingly, it was built by the founder of Siri.</p><p>What’s really surprising is that, despite all this hoopla, it’s hard to find a single chatbot that’s actually a really good product. Of course, we can wrangle over the definition of what makes a good product, but in its simplest terms, a great product would have three traits: (1) It’s simple and easy to use; (2) It works well 99 percent of the time; and (3) It removes or reduces friction in whatever it was you want it to do.</p><p>So back to the question — why do chatbots suck? I mean, there’s not a single chatbot I can think of that has won wide praise, or, more importantly, that has proven that chatbots are actually easier to use than an app. So why is this? Let’s take a closer look.</p><p>Viv and Siri both suffer from this; they aim to cover everything, and in the process compromise on quality. To understand why a broad scope is problematic, we need to first understand how chatbots work.</p><p>Chatbots basically have two parts to them: the “brain” and the “body.”</p><p>The first part is the “brain.” To understand what this brain is, think of a car. Inside a car you have an engine that makes the car move. And attached to that engine you have a body that you can customise to your needs — you could have a four-wheeler, a sporty roadster or just a normal sedan. The same engine could be used in many different ways depending on the body you attach to it.</p><p>That’s kind of how chatbots work, too. The “brain” is like this giant nervous system that takes words that humans say and converts them into actionable code. In a very narrow-scope chatbot, there’s only so much that a human can say.</p><p>For example, if someone built a chatbot to help you book flights, you can imagine about 100-200 things a human could possibly say to the chatbot. So, it’s quite easy to build a brain for this need. I can do it in a few weeks and be pretty sure that I’ll get 99 percent accuracy in responding to the human. But now imagine a chatbot whose scope is much wider — like Siri. You could say literally anything to it.</p><p>For Siri to correctly understand everything is incredibly difficult. It requires an immense engineering effort, and takes time. If it takes a human baby years to learn a language, it will surely take humans years to artificially build one. And then too, they will fail, because they can never quite replicate the irrational aspects of human behavior. Just like you can never predict what a six-year-old will say. But you can predict what a 40-year-old will say.</p><p>The second part of chatbots is the “body.” As I said, this is the “easy” part of it. It needs to be built and customized, but it’s literally just a vast body of knowledge. Compiling it can take time, depending on the industry. For something like travel bookings via a chatbot, the body of knowledge you need is not immense. I imagine you could literally plug your chatbot into a TripAdvisor API and deliver a pretty robust product.</p><p>But for anything in financial services, which is the world in which I operate, the barriers and the time it takes to compile this body of knowledge is immense. Most financial services websites aren’t accustomed to talking like a real human. Chatbots, by nature, need to talk like humans. They need to be simple and easy to understand. Translating from banking lingo/websites to chatbot-friendly lingo is time-consuming and hard. Hard because financial products are by default complex, and describing them in simple, layman’s terms is therefore quite hard.</p><p>As strange as it may sound, most chatbots aren’t actually intelligent. Well, at least not the ones that are used. How do you know if a chatbot is intelligent? Here are two defining traits: (1) It is able to “take care of itself” and get better with time; and (2) It lets you say or ask literally anything you want to.</p><p>Let’s take Tay — the Microsoft chatbot — as an example. Yes, it was intelligent. It tried to learn as people spoke to it. And, in theory, it should have gotten better with time — better in that it starts seeing patterns without having to be “told” about them. What about an unintelligent app? Most Facebook Messenger bots, for example the CNN chatbot, are not intelligent. Why? Because you can only go down one of the many pre-set paths on them.</p><p>The apps that are most likely to get it right — to actually do what they’re supposed to do without screwing up — are the unintelligent ones, because the number of “paths” you can go down is finite.</p><p>This is an interesting one. Most chatbots you see being demo-ed, for example Viv, completely gloss over this minute but important detail. The thing is, with most good apps, you actually type very little. It’s swipe swipe, touch touch, and you’re done. With most chatbots, this is not the case.</p><p>Most chatbots don’t support voice yet, which means you literally have to type everything. Not surprisingly, this means more time to complete the task — so it’s actually less efficient to use a chatbot than to use an app! Which is totally counterintuitive. And when you factor in the delays caused by the chatbot not understanding what you are communicating, the efficiency becomes ever worse — because now you have to re-type your question and hope the chatbot gets it.</p><p>Not at all. But it does suggest that it’s still very early days for chatbots. Ten to 15 years back, when apps started taking over the world, the benefits were crystal clear. It was just quicker and easier to use an app on your phone to do stuff than to try to use the mobile web.</p><p>Today, the same benefits — speed and efficiency — aren’t apparent when I use chatbots versus the mobile web. And even when they are, the lack of accuracy means I’m</p>",

    "content": "<p>Yahoo has made no secret of its ambitions and advances in mobile, earlier this month reporting 450 million monthly active users and search and display mobile ad revenues growing 100%. In CEO Marissa Mayer’s words, Yahoo is a “mobile first company.”</p><p>Now, sources say that Yahoo has closed in on an acquisition that could potentially boost its role in mobile further: it is buying Flurry, the mobile app analytics and advertising startup, with a price that could be anywhere between $300 million and $1 billion. Kara Swisher is also reporting that Yahoo is interested in the company.</p><p>Update: A source is telling us that the price was substantially lower, clocking at around $200-$300M. And Yahoo has confirmed the acquisition.</p><p>As one poster on a Secret note about the rumor described it, “The price will be low if it’s value[d] as an ad tech company, high if it’s valued based on the analytics SDK footprint. Marisa [sic] likes to overpay for things.”</p><p>We have reached out both to Flurry and Yahoo for comment.</p><p>We’d been hearing for a while now that Flurry was on the market, with one source suggesting it was looking for a price of around $700 million – $800 million. Other potential buyers, we heard, included Amazon. But given how far Amazon itself has advanced in building its own mobile analytics services to court more developers, it looks like that ship sailed on its own.</p><p>The Secret note posted about a Flurry sale to Yahoo is now deleted, it seems, but this is how it looked:</p><p>One source close to Flurry says the company has been “racing toward a sale” and confirmed that Yahoo was looking like the most likely buyer for a while now, with a sale made public by the end of the summer.</p><p>“Yahoo was a pretty open secret around the office,” the source said. “Their team came by for executive meetings several times over the course of several months.”</p><p>Founded in 2005 and headquartered in San Francisco, Flurry is one of the largest companies in the area of app analytics.</p><p>It’s an area that has seen some consolidation. For example, Onavo was acquired by Facebook. AppAnnie has acquired Distimo. And Twitter has also made a number of acquisitions that have boosted its mobile analytics capabilities.</p><p>In Flurry’s own words, “Since the launch of the smartphone, Flurry has helped grow the app economy into a $100+ billion industry.” By that, it’s referring to the fact that it works with some 170,000 developers, picking up data from 150 billion app sessions each month, to provide information to app publishers about their audiences, app usage and app performance, providing insights to improve how apps work.</p><p>And to improve how apps make money. Flurry uses that data, for example, to power its advertising platform, which is used by brands to target specific audiences on apps in Flurry’s network, and by developers to monetise their apps with more relevant inventory.</p><p>It has raised close to $74 million, with backers including Borealis Ventures, Crosslink Capital, DFJ, Draper Richards, First Round, InterWest Parnters, Menlo Ventures and Union Square Ventures.</p><p>Of course, Yahoo seems to be a strong candidate for lots of wild mobile acquisition rumors. But you can see where Flurry fits well with Yahoo’s existing business focus, specifically across mobile, advertising and B2B products. Especially as the company continues to see pressure on its more legacy businesses like desktop display advertising revenue and search revenue.</p><p>Specifically, what Flurry could give to Yahoo is not just a boost in mobile advertising revenues, but, as Yahoo builds out its ad tech business, a more central role in how others are monetising and using mobile.</p><p>Effectively, this gives Yahoo another strong string to its mobile bow: while it builds out its own apps and app inventory, and advertising to run across them, Yahoo could be bringing in a platform that could become the go-to place for other mobile players to boost and develop their own app businesses.</p><p>“Flurry draws in more behavioral data from mobile apps than any other company, and we put it to work to help app marketers build a high quality audience,” Flurry notes on its site. “Flurry serves video, banners and interstitial ads using the most advanced targeting technology in mobile today to increase installs, campaign ROI and retention. Cross promoting your own apps is always free with Flurry.”</p><p>Yahoo says that the 450 million monthly active mobile users it recorded in Q2 was over 100% growth over two years (in 2012 the figure was 200 million). Mayer, in her earnings report remarks, also noted that the time spent by its audience on mobile was up by 79% in the last year. She said that the company has “more than 400 Yahoos working exclusively on building iOS and Android apps.”</p><p>She also mentioned mobile search as a place for further concentration — an area where Flurry’s mobile app analytics could also come in usefully. “We really believe that the mobile search experience to be completely different than that of traditional desktop search,” she said. “There is a clear opportunity here and we are continuing to look at ways to deliver more innovative, more intuitive search experiences on mobile phones.”</p><p>In the search for new growth and business lines that could potentially give the company a stronger counterbalance against Google, Yahoo has been building up its mobile business, both in terms of products and talent to develop and run them.</p><p>A lot of this has come by way of acquisitions. Since Marissa Mayer took over as CEO in 2012, there have been 30 known acquisitions either directly or indirectly related to mobile products (we’re listing them below for those interested in keeping track).</p><p>That’s not counting IntoNow, a social TV app Yahoo acquired in 2011 before Mayer joined the company. IntoNow’s co-founder and CEO Adam Cahan is now the SVP overseeing all mobile and emerging products at Yahoo.</p><p>PeerCDN (not for mobile specifically but improves all website speed which is helpful to mobile)</p><p>SkyPhrase</p>",

Today, mobile app marketing firm Fiksu is introducing a new product that will allow Apple Watch app developers to track adoption of Watch apps among early adopters, with the hopes of informing them whether their new app is a hit or a miss.</p><p>The service lets these developers track a number of events related to their app, including launches, registrations, purchases and more.</p><p>In addition, the firm says, because of the way Watch apps are dependent on being paired with a parent iPhone application, developers are able to utilize Fiksu’s existing iOS SDK to now track apps on the iPhone and Apple Watch.</p><p>Doing so requires a few extra steps on an app developer’s part, including adding a line of code to the iPhone app and then tagging the Apple Watch events they want to track. The company claims this process takes around 10 minutes in total.</p><p>App developers and marketers can then use the company’s online analytics portal to break up their app’s user base into segments, creating a group that separates out the Apple Watch audience from others for retargeting purposes.</p><p>The additional capabilities make Fiksu one of the first large analytics providers to provide a specific solution for tracking Apple Watch app adoption and engagement. However, Yahoo has also announced this month that its Flurry analytics service will support Apple Watch apps. And App Annie also recently updated its Store Stats to track Apple Watch.</p><p>Fiksu allowed a longtime client, Shotzoom, to be the first test the service in advance of its public release. The app maker used the service with their app Golfshot: Golf GPS iPhone app in order to identify how many of their users were adopting the Apple Watch, how many activated the watch, and discover whether those users would be more likely than others to upgrade to their paid application.</p><p>The theory, it seems, is that those who are buying Apple Watch may have more disposable income, and therefore would be a better group to target when it comes to encouraging pro subscriptions.</p><p>Fiksu says that now several other clients are also now getting set up with the Apple Watch analytics product, as the service goes live for all customers.</p><p>The additional capabilities aren’t being sold separately, however, but are instead being bundled in with any Fiksu engagement. The marketing firm has a flexible pricing model, but most commonly charges a fixed percentage of the media spend it manages for clients, though it also sometimes does straight CPI (cost per install), CPC (cost per click), and CPE (cost per engagement) deals with select clients.</p><p>The move comes at a time when Apple itself has just shaken up the app analytics industry by offering a free service of its own to all registered iOS developers, which launched into beta just this past week. However, Fiksu points out that Apple has yet to say how its App Analytics beta will work with Apple Watch.</p><p>That being said, while the focus for now with Apple’s new product is on metrics that only Apple can get – like App Store stats, for example – it will also track in-app events. That means that even if the App Analytics beta isn’t able to track Apple Watch events out of the gate, it will likely do so in the future.</p>",

They go to the weather app on their phone, or open up weather.com, or perhaps they lick their finger and stick it out the window. I, however, get my weather updates from Poncho.</p><p>The betaworks-backed weather service sends you relevant weather updates for the day straight to your email or phone, tailored to when you will likely be outside. The product has only been available in New York since launching a year ago, but has today expanded to include Chicago.</p><p>The key to Poncho is its simplicity.</p><p>When you first sign up, Poncho will ask you a few quick and painless questions, like what time you leave the house for work, when you take your lunch break, when you come home, and whether or not you have a puppy that needs to go for walks. Then, the user simply specifies whether they want their updates via text or email, and what time they want the daily update.</p><p>From there, Poncho sends you a simple email or text every day (I set mine to arrive at 7am each morning, but I have friends that get their updates the night before). Within the alert, there’s temperature info for each time during the day where you might be outside.</p><p>But it goes beyond that. Each Poncho alert has a cute, conversational message about the day’s weather. It feels as though you’re getting the daily update from a funny friend who isn’t afraid to send gifs.</p><p>In terms of generating revenue, Poncho is wading into the territory slowly. The company has made no formal announcements around monetization, but we’ve seen some interesting deals presented through Poncho. For example, on a rainy day last winter, Poncho and HealthyOut got together and offered a deal on food delivery.</p><p>To check out more about Poncho, head over to the website right here.</p>",

The so-called Snapbots will dispense Spectacles in either Black, Coral or Teal starting today, letting you first try them on virtually via an integrated AR display.</p><p>Snapbot accepts debit or credit cards, and will process your $129 purchase in around 10 seconds according to the Spectacles support page. The mouth on the anthropomorphized commerce vector lights up when your Specs are dispensed, and the bot also distributes a paper receipt so you can expense your first-person video fashion sunware as the legitimate business purchase they definitely are.</p><p>Snapbots can be found using a locator tool on Snapchat’s website, which so far shows one in LA near Venice Beach in Oakwood, which is where the company’s HQ is located. If you happen to be in the neighbourhood, let us know if you’re able to pick some up. Act quick, because the Snapbot’s only stay in one place for about a day, and will be rotating around to new, fun tourist-type spots on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Spectacles, revealed earlier this year, are Snap, Inc.’s first hardware product – a pair of sunglasses with an embedded video camera designed for use exclusively with Snapchat.</p>",

A.-based company to “address our immediate liquidity issues, restructure our balance sheet and correct structural issues including reducing our high occupancy costs and restoring compliance with our debt covenants,” the company said in a press statement. “We expect to maintain our high level of customer service and emerge stronger and even better able to deliver the product and experience that our customers expect and that we take pride in bringing to market.”</p><p>WWD had reported in September that Nasty Gal was “on the hunt for a possible buyer.”</p><p>Nasty Gal has raised $65 million over the years, including from Index Ventures and renowned retail executive Ron Johnson.</p><p>Recode reported yesterday that this filing was coming. It also noted that the chapter (no pun intended) follows a couple of turbulent years at Nasty Gal. In addition to laying off 10 percent of its workforce in February to trim costs, it has been the target of numerous employee lawsuits, including by former staffers who say they were fired for becoming pregnant.</p><p>Amoruso stepped down as the company’s CEO in January of last year but remained involved as executive chairman.</p><p>Recode now says Amoruso — who has found ways outside of Nasty Gal to capitalize on her success, including writing two books (#Girlboss and Nasty Galaxy) and inspiring a new comedy series on Netflix — is resigning from that post.</p>",
